""dynamic"" path (the path can vary by device), the database itself and
all database updateds occur through execution of DDL statements via
changescripts.

Thus, this import is not necessary now, nor has it ever been in the
past. It just happened to get committed.

Instead of using ArrayLists, which can dynamically allocate memory up to
arbitrary size and cause OOM errors, the algorithm is now using boolean
arrays that are preallocated with the maximum width and height of the
images dimensions. The boolean arrays are multidimensional and default
to false values. When a pixel is to be filled with a color, the
corresponding boolean[x][y] value is set to true.

This is faster than using ArrayLists and ultimately uses much less
heap memory.
