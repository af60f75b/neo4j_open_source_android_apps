was an edit trigger which means that when I double clicked the activated signal wouldn't get sent.
But when I don't do the connection, a double click doesn't result in activation signal
being sent. This is weird. If I do connect doubleclick both signals get sent. If I don't,
neither get sent. I'm going to have to figure this out.
