The notification revamp is still coming!  Really!  Soon as I figure out
where I'm going with it!

Now, AlarmService will request 30W stocks for TOMORROW, not TODAY.
Effectively, owing to how the stock fetcher works, this will mean it
only fetches one stock price (30W graticules take yesterday's stocks, so
a request for tomorrow's stock gives us today, which means the non-30W
request for today already exists in the cache).  Also, it means that
notifications for known locations involving 30W stocks will trigger for
the NEXT day's locations, which is a lot more useful in 30W situations,
given when AlarmService wakes up.

So I'm thinking the Known Locations issue has to do with Doze.  It turns
out there's not much I can do about that apart from setting up a Firebase
instance to... um... have it send push messages back to a tiny Android app
for just a once-a-day update of a handful of bytes?  Seriously?  That's the
only way I can assure a network connection during Doze, apart from having
the user whitelist the app?

Regardless, this makes AlarmService be slightly more persistent in getting
a network connection.  Now it'll snooze on a network failure (rather than
just give up) AND I changed it to ignore idle on the alarms (rather than
use the Doze-unfriendly setRepeating method).  Hopefully this makes it try
a bit harder to get the Known Location checks.

In an incredible stroke of good luck, it turns out the way I set up the
layouts is really super good for the way multi-window handles the
activities.  Since it just gives new values to the layout mechanism (for
our purposes, the key is ""no longer sw600dp""), we can just check if the
fragment container exists, the same as we already do when deciding if we
want to launch the activity (phones) or put the fragment up (tablets).
This does mean that tablets can now load the activity versions of the extra
fragments if the user attempts to visit them from a multi-window-shrunk
screen, but that's perfectly acceptable.

In order to sanely support multiwindow stuff (and because I never really
liked the kluged-together tablet layout I came up with to begin with), the
way the extra fragments (detailed info and wiki posting) work will change
with the Nougat-ready version.  This is the first step of that change: The
fragments now live in the lower-right corner of the map view, rather than
split the screen in half.

This does cause things to crash very very much when resizing the screen in
a way that leaves not enough space for the fragments, but that will be
worked out in time.

Surprise!  We're in Nougat 7.1 now!  This will add shortcuts to the
launcher icon (where applicable).  The shortcuts are simply the three ways
Geohash Droid can start (closest hashpoint, last-used graticule, graticule
picker).

This works, per se, but I haven't tested what happens if, for instance, GHD
gets these intents while it's already running, which I think is possible?
I'd assume that goes into onNewIntent, but I'll have to mess with it more
to be sure.  Also, those shortcuts will get their own icons, don't worry
about that.

And I need to test it against a non-Nougat 7.1 device to make sure it
doesn't throw a fit when it doesn't know what to do with shortcuts.

Yes, this does mean I'm coming up with a plan to properly support Nougat's
window resizing feature.  More on that later.

the HttpClient 4.0 preview (what Android's stock HttpClient was based off
of) was made by the Apache team to the 4.4 final release.  This should
cover those changes and get rid of the org.apache.http.legacy dependency.

did.

As a side effect of this change, the entire local copy of the HttpClient
multipart entity classes is now unnecessary, so out it goes.

misjudged how much people would miss the default of ""use a specific
Graticule"" from versions before 0.9.0, rather than ""use whatever Graticule
gives the closest hashpoint"" I used afterward.  Whoops.  So, this will be
an option in KnownLocationsPicker and will be respected during

now does what's expected (that is, conducting the search).

Search results are now drawn on the map (still need a custom marker icon
for those).  They don't do anything yet, nor is there any error reporting.
The addresses will also get redrawn on a restart.

Moving along, the map will only re-center on initial start or after a
search comes back.  MapFragment does a good job of preserving the camera as

BiMap rather than a plain Map so that it can later look up the marker
associated with a given KnownLocation when the dialog is complete (if, for
instance, the screen was rotated, destroying all Markers so it doesn't
know which to edit).

Turns out there's a bug in some Android firmwares that causes it to not use
the correct ClassLoader when unmarshalling a Parcelable when used over a
remote interface (such as a BroadcastIntent).  This means that things like
Info or Graticule will run into problems when they're sent as such.

StockService sends them as such, as it talks back to everything via
broadcasts.  Thus, it now uses a Bundle to talk back.  Bundles don't try to
unmarshall things until needed, and the ClassLoader can be properly
assigned then.

Probably quite a while ago, to be honest.  However, this should be what

to view pages on the wiki, as those are now under different directories in
the Geohashing wiki.  This still needs proper testing (I'll need to make a

Aha!  I think that finally nails down the bug where it sometimes wouldn't
get a proper info on startup!  The inits on the modes happen during
doReadyChecks (at least when CentralMap initially starts).  doReadyChecks
will do so only after both the map and the API client are ready, and the
last of those to fire is the API client, during onStart.  The init on
ExpeditionMode is when it determines what to do with the bundle it has, be
it do an empty start or load the last known Info.  All nice and good,
except that the stock receiver (needed to listen for stock broadcasts from
StockService and relay them to the modes) was only being registered during
onResume, so there was a chance the API client would finish connecting
beforehand, which in turn meant ExpeditionMode was firing off a stock
lookup before CentralMap was going to be listening for it.

Now, the stock receiver is registered before the API client is asked to
connect, meaning that it'll always be registered before doReadyChecks calls
for the current mode to init.

I *think* that's what was doing it.  If it was going to doEmptyStart() from
init() like that, it was completely ignoring any data already in the

start can't complete, meaning the flag is never cleared) and gets the
graticule manually in SelectAGraticuleMode.

Okay, I think I've got the idea.  While CentralMap is up, all location
requests will go through CentralMap itself.  That is, the modes no longer
hold their own LocationListeners, depending on everything to come from
CentralMap's one single listener.  This means there's one single permission
request, rather than trying to keep track of three or so that come in at
once when ExpeditionMode starts up.

This isn't done yet, mind; there still seems to be a bug where the auto-
detected graticule isn't the closest one, and I want callbacks in place to
make things behave properly when refusing permissions (i.e. remove the
""Waiting for location..."" banner, disable zoom-to-user and zoom-to-both,
making sure the Find Closest button is disabled in Select-A-Graticule).
Plus, this doesn't fix the wiki or detailed info screens.

Well, this *works*, per se.  Kind of.  With this in play, all location
requests will pass through a permissions check first and prompt the user
as appropriate.

Unfortunately, it does so a little too aggressively; since this is just
adapting old code, three or four location checks might go up at once (the
empty start, the initial zoom, the InfoBox, the My Location dot on the main
map, etc).  This causes Android to present that popup that many times at
once, and if they all get denied, it gives the error explanation popup that
many times, too.  I'll have to rethink this, but this is where it stands
right now.

Curiously, it seems that MANAGE_DOCUMENTS doesn't require a permissions
check.  I can read images and send them to the wiki without any problems.

If, on initial startup, the day's stock value isn't posted yet (i.e. the

user tries to input a date manually, ExpeditionMode wouldn't automatically
change to the appropriate hashpoint (assuming the new date has a valid
stock value).  This change should fix that by ensuring it still goes out
to StockService even if an Info never came back, using the first Location
it grabbed on startup for the Graticule.

After much debate with myself as to what, exactly, CentralMap SHOULD do on
initial startup, I came to the conclusion that, unless it has a saved
instance state (which would make it not be an initial startup, I guess),
CentralMap will tell ExpeditionMode to get the closest Info for the day's
hash (assuming it's been posted yet) and start with that.  I'm pretty sure
that's by far the most common use of the app.

Now, this will have to be revisited once I get something like
TracklogService running, as that may mean an expedition is ""active"" when
the app is closed, but for now, this'll do.

I'm also amazed it seemed to work perfectly the first time I put it on my
tablet, which makes me think it's subtly broken very badly and I'll learn
that the hard way later.

ErrorBanner can now be set to hide the close button.  This way, certain
messages (i.e. ""Waiting for your location"") can stick around until done.
Otherwise, the user's got a good chance of being confused, thinking the
close button would cancel the action that's caused the banner to show up
(i.e. they would expect that to stop a location check, which it won't).

To that end, that very example I just mentioned is now non-closeable in
SelectAGraticuleMode.  It'll also show the banner when fetching stock data
both there and in ExpeditionMode.

Also, simply requesting a stock won't close the ErrorBanner anymore.

Apparently onSaveInstanceState can be called in an Activity even when it's

was not aware of this.  Because cleanUp in CentralMapMode was ALWAYS the
way the Bundle was saved, and said Bundle was being saved in
onSaveInstanceState, this meant the mode was being wiped clean but never
replaced later by onCreate, leaving things in a goofy state.

So now CentralMapMode has an onSaveInstanceState method of its own.  That's
where the Bundle-writing happens, and cleanUp only does cleanup tasks, and
is only called when the mode is definitely going down.

GHDBasicDialogBuilder takes care of.  It'll be used, for instance, in

Oops.  Forgot that PreferenceActivity (the new one, at least) uses a sort
of default SharedPreferences object, and that one isn't referenced from the
old PREFS_BASE variable's String.  To that end, everything (that I see as
relevant going forward) now uses getDefaultSharedPreferences instead,
meaning PreferencesActivity will actually do something.

Note that ""relevant"" means stuff that might not be wiped as soon as I get
to redoing the main interface.  Also, PREFS_BASE will have to stick around
so I can drag all the preferences from previous versions into the new
format without making the user do it manually.

AlarmService replaces the main functionality of the old StockService (and

does the stock pre-fetching at 9:30am every day.

non-functional in this branch, so don't try to do anything with it.  I'll
get something in ServiceTester to test AlarmService soon.

this is that the service doesn't need to remain up and in the foreground
when we're waiting for the network, meaning we don't need the notification
to be up, meaning DialogHandler goes away, plus the foreground mode lock
isn't needed, meaning ForegroundCompatService dies, plus all the supporting
stuff each needed, not to mention the issues I was having with
DialogHandler in the first place...

As it turns out, the service will most likely be killed if it goes to the
background and stops doing anything, even if it's waiting for a network
connection update.  So, now StockService will remain in the foreground (and
thus less likely to be killed) until the network comes back.  It's still
not DOING anything during that time, but its network receiver will stick
around.

First, I was not aware that destroying a service takes down all its
manually-registered BroadcastReceivers.  That sort of makes the
NetworkReceiver useless (the service is destroyed after registering for
updates) and leaky (the receiver isn't unregistered at onDestroy time).  So
first off, this makes sure we don't stopSelf on StockService when we're in
the middle of waiting for the network.

Also, moved the alarm registration to STOCK_INIT handling.  Because that
seems to make a lot more sense.

we're dealing with a large/medium screen (DatePicker) or a small screen
(DateButton).  So, those calls have been removed to clean up the code a

As it turns out, the bug I fixed for DatePicker isn't in all devices, as
there's still bug reports coming in about the date not matching what it
says at times.  So I've made large use the same DateButtons that the small
screens use, as I know that shouldn't have the same problems.

To that end, DateButton is also more blinged up, complete with a custom
XML attribute to decide what sort of date should be shown, as there were a
few layout problems in the landscape view.

everything fits.  The image was moved to the right side since we don't use
the wide flickable gallery.  Everything else was reorganized to fit and to
make sure the small screen doesn't cut off text in any case.

Second, the portrait wiki posting screens were rearranged so that the
anonymous warning text will always fit properly.

Third, a large-size picture upload screen was added.  I've got more room to
work with on a large screen, so the text there is more verbose to make the
layout look better.

Two problems still to solve: Portrait small screen picture uploading won't
fit the anonymous warning, and for some reason it appears the G1 thinks it
is a large screen, meaning it displays the longer text and thus ruins the
layout in its limited space.  Must research.

Attributes.  Yeah, that's what this is looking for.  Sure glad I'm deciding
this NOW, before I dump the hundred or so achievements in.

one large category (i.e. all timing achievements) and ignored a couple
(ultimate and ""there should be a ribbon"").  Also added their strings in.

I'm ignoring things like the Bill Gates achievement (absurd) or the No
Batteries Geohash (using GHD, by definition, disqualifies you).  More to
come later.

Next up is the idea Thomas Hirsch had for queueing up wiki posts to send
later if the connection is bad.  To facilitate this, I'm working on making
a generic QueueService.  This is so that the attempts can be made in the
background, report back if any fatal errors happen (bad password, etc), and
so the queue can be observed and manipulated after the fact.  Should be
great, if I can pull it off the way I want to.

So GeohashService didn't work as planned so far.  Fair enough.  In its
place, LocationAwareActivity is going up.  It will make a common Activity
base class for anything that should start listening for location updates at
resume() time and stop at pause() time.  This will go into the detail
screen and the two wiki screens (not the main map, since that needs a
different base class for the map itself).

Ah, well.  I guess it's better in the long run to just adapt MyLocationOverlay to suit our needs, given it already does just about everything we need anyway.  All I really need to do is remove its ability to talk back to MainMap, as GeohashService now does all that for us.

Next commit will be me deleting it from trunk.  It'll stick around in the history.

The small screen now has its own layout sections (layout-small-land and layout-small-port).  Right now, the only modified layouts are for the main screen, replacing the rather a bit huge DatePicker with a DateButton that leads to a DatePickerDialog.

This also adds in DateButton, a button that displays a DatePickerDialog and displays the currently selected date as its text field.

And THAT brought with it a change to the main GeohashDroid class, which allows it to try to figure out whether it's on the small or not-small screens by means of checking for the existence of the DatePicker, and acting accordingly.

While this does work for now, DateButton isn't preserving its state, meaning it'll reset back to the current date on an orientation shift and the dialog won't stay popped up if it was up.  I need to fix that.

However, the only time it's initialized is during the main GeohashDroid class.  Meaning, if, for instance, the user is in MainMap (a somewhat memory-heavy Activity due to it being a MapActivity), navigates to another app (i.e. the View Wiki Page option, or an incoming phone call), and the OS thinks memory is low, it could terminate Geohash Droid, expecting to start it back up from a retained state when it comes back in.

Unfortunately, if MainMap or whatnot needs the database at that time (such as the Nearby Points feature), this will crash, as mStore will be null, seeing as how HashBuilder.initialize won't have been run.

This fix is a quick hack that ensures mStore is always defined at any point it's needed by encapsulating it in an accessor that can create it from scratch if need be.  This does mean all calls that refer to mStore now need a Context, which has also been addressed here.

Later, a REAL fix would be to wrap all database access into a Service that knows to initialize HashBuilder without the hackish Context requirement every time.

This, when finished, will remove a LOT of logic from the main class, which is Good(tm), though it will still be a bit of work before it's functioning properly.

To that end, StockGrabber is a new activity.  When called with an Intent containing a Graticule and a Calendar, it does all the stock grabby stuff via HashBuilder and returns a stock value (or an error) as a result.  This way, the main class won't need all the special-casing for if the activity is paused/destroyed while the stock grabbing is in progress.

It SHOULD look like a normal dialog if something needs to be done, but apparently that doesn't quite look right if I use Theme.Dialog.  Thus, I still need to rewrite it so it looks right (whether ""right"" is ""like a dialog"" or ""right for this"").

Also note that the main class is broken for now.

It will also behave slightly differently with old data: It will remember the last proper data it found and rely on that if it can't get most recent data from LocationManager or that data is too old.  This does mean that if the last thing remembered was too old, it'll still use that, but the only significant way that'll happen is if the user stays on the preferences screen for more than two minutes from the detail screen.

That shouldn't have been there in the first place (and it was my debug key anyway).  You'll need to define api_map_key in another file in order for this to compile.
