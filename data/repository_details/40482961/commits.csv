This is done because the search feature has been changed from a dialog to a search field in the top of the fragment. Searching for a vessel now zooms the view to contain all the matched tools. Clicking a clustering of tools now zoom in to match the bounds of the contained tools.
User settings have been moved from a dialog to its own fragment for cleaner presentation.
Added and updated layout files for tablets as this was long overdue.
Added drawable folders and icons for different resolutions.
Made some changes to when location permissions are requested, primarily in tools fragment.
