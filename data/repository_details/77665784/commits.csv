Apparently, Google Play doesn't allow you to downgrade target SDK
versions (attempted in 0d245ebee3c9bf324dccbea5d99e18b3f6de9ba1)
and refuses to upload the APK. So implement it and bump target SDK
to 25 again.

From Android 6 (API 23) permissions are checked at runtime, not
at install time. This would require using the Support Library or
APIs introduced in level 23, so just downgrade targetSdkVersion
to bring back the old behavior.
