moved the setOnCheckedChangeListener command for the checkbox to the
init method because I realized it does not need to be updated whenever
the prefId changes, because the handler calls the getPrefId method,
which'll respond to changes to the prefId on the fly. Finally, added a

aren't called if there's nothing to set.

If the question record was built using a 'capacity' of 1, which should
represent no repetition, it would originally throw an exception, causing
the app to crash. There was no way to run a check before running the
parent constructor, or run it in a try-catch, so I altered the class to
remove an item after every addition, which leaves an empty space
constantly, but is effective in regulating the frequency of repeating
questions, while allowing the ability to disable the whole feature.

would reset automatically when one returns using the in-app navigation
buttons, when using the device's back button it would not. This bit of

I once programmed the app to delay rebuilding the question bank after
someone returned from the option screen by half a second. Because
otherwise the question bank would rebuild before the changes to the
option screen were recorded, making the whole thing useless. But I since
changed something, likely the point when the changes on the option
screen are recorded, that rendered the delay redundant. So I removed it.

twice in a row. It also includes a check to prevent the limiter from
introducing an infinite loop by having the required number of unique
questions be greater than the number of questions available.

Because I'm modeling the design of this app with the same progression
used in the game Learn Japanese To Survive, I decided to finally look up
how progression is actually handled in the parts I haven't played yet.
As a result, I learned that the Y and W groups were split up in the game
with the single N consonant paired with the W group, so I modified this
app to reflect that.

The methodology for including borders separating items on the options
menu was very kludgy. It used a background drawable that was a box with
a black line at the bottom. This caused problems because the background
colour had to be explicitly stated in code, which caused issues with
certain android versions, because not all of them used the same default
background colour. I could've forced the app to use a predefined
background colour, but I thought this would cause more problems than it
would solve. So I did something much more complex, yet paradoxically
simpler, by just adding a line in an ImageView object at the bottom of
each SetSelectionItem, and fiddling around with the Layout containers.
Don't know why I didn't think of it sooner.
