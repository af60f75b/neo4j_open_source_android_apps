Turns out that I had been doing this wrong the whole time.
Instantiating a class that extends from TableRow, and inflating an XML
layout into it which has a TableRow root node actually yields a TableRow
inside another TableRow.

The correct approach for a situation like this is to use a <merge> node
as the root node of the XML, which actually collapses to be no node at
all once it is inflated.

Also, add a little ""d"" label in front of the dX sides input, to
hopefully make it more clear what these inputs do.

That's an ugly and outdated approach.  The modern way to achieve this is
to make each of the switchable views into Fragments, and to switch
between them using a ViewPager, which is much more visually intuitive
and, as an added bonus, supports swipe gestures.

Further, now that the views are set up as Fragments, I can produce an
alternate layout for tablets that includes both fragments side-by-side,

conjure up a simple confirmation dialog, this is still a win in terms of
lines of code once I took out the activity class and layout XML for the

Instead of using an SQLite database, which is patently overkill for the
amount of data this app stores, I am now serialising all of the app data
into a JSON string and storing that string as a SharedPreference.

The JSON string is an array of profile objects, and the 'presets' member
of each profile object is an array of preset objects.

Because this update required me to modify large portions of the code,
I've also taken this opportunity to clean up a lot of Lint issues, fix a
few misbehaviours and take greater care with user input checking.

This commit is a WIP, the use of preset includes does not appear to be
working at the moment.

I found out to my chagrin that when you switch the phone's orientation,
the entire activity gets binned and re-created.  Normally, any view with
an id attribute has its state saved into a Bundle, which is then
restored when the view comes back up.  Unfortunately, this works about
as well as a porcelain cricket bat when multiple view have the same id;
as they do in my counters because I have reused the layout.

The result was that when you flip third into landscape, it not only
looks horrible but it sets ALL of the counters to 1.  Not helpful.

I fixed this by adding a screenOrientation attribute in the manifest, so
the orientation will stay in portrait, but that didn't stop android from
destroying and recreating my activity, so I still had that saved state
problem.

This was fixed by implementing my own onSaveInstanceState() and
onRestoreInstanceState() methods, which take care of saving and
restoring the value of the counters.

This includes some behind-the-scenes work on how the ThirdActivity
stores its config.  Previously, the config variable was blown away and
rebuilt from the counters any time one of the counters was updated.  In
order to keep track of the last selected preset's id and name, I needed
to make the config persist, and to do that I had to break a nasty loop
condition.

The loop condition was triggered when I set the config.  This would
populate each of the counters with the value from the config, which
would in turn trigger the event to update the config from the counters!
I worked around this by setting a special flag called ConfigImmutable at
the start of updateFromConfig() and unsetting it at the end.  This way
the code knows to blithely ignore any updates *to* the config while it
is busy updating *from* the config.

The 'gtk' subdirectory has been removed and relevant files moved into
the top level directory.  The 'gtk' directory was really only there to
differentiate the PyGTK port of the app from the original native win32
version.

The 'gtk/include' subdirectory was removed entirely, as this only
consisted of image files built from the SVG sources.

The Makefile in images/ was replaced by a Rules.mk include file, which
is now included from the top-level Makefile.  This file includes all the
intelligence about the image files, how to build them and what their
prerequisites are, but cannot be used to build image files on its own.
So switching into the images/ directory and typing `make app.png`, for
example, will not work anymore.  Instead, all make commands should be
issued from the top-level, e.g., `make images/app.png`.  This has the
advantage that the top-level Makefile now effectively knows about all
dependencies in the project.
