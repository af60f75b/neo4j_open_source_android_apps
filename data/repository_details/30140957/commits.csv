Since we only access accounts managed by our own account manager, we
don't actually need GET_ACCOUNTS as of Android M+. We could continue
to declare GET_ACCOUNTS with maxSdkVersion=""M"" to keep older platforms
working, but this has policy requirements which come along with it
that are not worth the trouble.

Also get the build working with the latest Android Studio and bump the
version in preparation for a release.

When authorization is lost, show a notification to the user. Yahoo
recently had some auth issue where they returned some 4xx error code
for a valid token request, leading us to delete the token. The
notification makes it clear that logging in again is necessary,
although ideally we would avoid revoking the token for transient
errors. Unfortunately there is no information available on what error
was being returned and how to tell whether an error is transient or
permanent.

Also, work around
https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=157481, which was
preventing auth errors from propagating correctly, by returning errors
via the provided AccountAuthenticatorResult rather than the returned
result Bundle.
