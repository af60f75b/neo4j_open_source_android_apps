* Also save preferences (the two checkboxes) before calling the service when forcing an address reload. Without saving first, the service will use the old settings, as they were only saved in the onPause hook beforehand (i.e. when switching away from the activity). This is therefore a bugfix for the old broken behaviour.
* Document that it also works on a Google Nexus S and add a few more debugging messages to the code.
