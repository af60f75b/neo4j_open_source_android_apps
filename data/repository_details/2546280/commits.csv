angle or the power to change, but not both. This could result in us getting
stuck forever on a local hill in the optimization space. Sometimes it is

A first try at implementing the weapons-buying state. It seems like the
easiest way to do this will be to create a modal dialog box inside RunGameAct.

We again need to use a Runnable object to start the dialog from the GUI
thread.

The dialog box doesn't cover the entire screen, although I think I can get it
to cover most of it. I want the background to be the sky of the upcoming
round, since that will look nice. Another possibility I am considering is
setting the background to the color of the player who is buying weapons-- just
to make it clearer who is buying in hot-seat games.

swaps you with a dead player. If nobody's dead, it will swap you with a
still-living player at random. In the 2-player game case, it can even put you

We really need to have all the user input be serialized. Otherwise we might
get weird drawing glitches if the user changes zoom factor or player angle
during a screen redraw, etc. The easiest way to serialize everything is to put
it all under mUserInputSem, so that's what I did. In theory, this could
degrade UI performance. Performance seems to be ok, though. If it becomes an
issue, I'll think about a message-queue based system. Hopefully it won't come
to that, though.

Eliminate onKeyDown(), etc. hooks. Keyboard input was only a temporary hack to
test things out. Get rid of some crusty old onPause() etc. stuff which hasn't
been used in a long time.

Change the coordinate system so that we have
viewX = mZoom * gameX rather than
gameX = mZoom * viewX.

In other words, mZoom is now the reciprocal of what it used to be. This
eliminates an expensive division to get slotWidth
(formerly slotWidth = 1/mZoom, now slotWidth = mZoom).
It also tends to minimize numerical errors by keeping mZoom in a nicer range
(0.5 - 60 or so) than before.

gameXtoOnscreenX() tends to happen a lot more than onscreenXtoGameX().
multiply is cheaper than divide. Therefore, it's good that we now have
gameXtoOnscreenX implemented as a multiply rather than a divide.

De-optimize zoomIn and zoomOut because I'm too lazy to fix the optimized
version. These functions only happen when the user requests them, and then
only as ""single shots,"" so they're not worth optimizing anyway.

Hard tabs mess up diffs and are against our coding standard. Eclipse apparently
cannot be trusted to keep hard tabs out of files, no matter what settings you
use. Eclipse also likes to consider hard tabs as 4 spaces, whereas everyone
else in the known universe prints them as 8.

This script searches the current directory for java files. It converts all
hard tabs in these files to 4 spaces. It also zaps spaces on the end of lines,
which are also against our coding standard (and Linus').

Replace a bunch of crazy hacks with a somewhat more well-thought-out
coordinate system.

Specifically, two coordinate systems. The in-game coordinate system
runs from (0...MAX_X) and (0...MAX_Y). The display coordinate system
goes from (0...canvasWidth) and (0...canvasHeight). To get from in-game
coordinates to display coordinates, you subtract an offset and divide
by a zoom factor.

My first attempt at having some kind of game logic going on.
My initial instinct was to serialize everything into the main() thread.
I did this because I believed that holding down a key would not give multiple
onKeyDown() calls. As it turns out, this is incorrect.

This code can be simplified a lot. A lot of code will be moved into
onKeyDown().

Move all graphics stuff into ScorchedGraphics.java. It was getting too
annoying having view and controller in the same file.

Rework object lifecycles a bit. ScorchedGraphics, ScorchedModel, and
ScorchedView are now all owned by the Activity at the top level. They can
communicate with each other, though. Only the controller should be mutating
the model. Of course, since Java lacks const, there is no practical
way to enforce this.

Locking is entirely handled by the controller. Hopefully this situation can
continue in the future.

Fix a locking issue in surfaceCreated(). Apparently it is not a good idea to
notify() the view, since other system components might be wait()ing on it.
Instead, create a semaphore-like object just for notifications.
Perhaps eventually mSurfaceHasBeenCreated itself can fill this function. Last
time I tried it was flaky. Perhaps I need to change it into a Boolean (class)
