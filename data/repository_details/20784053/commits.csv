The original method (set_byte_array) no longer needs a size parameter, since strcpy doesn't need one, so it has been removed from all of the corresponding calls.

TL;DR - Audio output works again.

Each Fragment now has its own bind to the Service, and therefore no longer rely on their parent Activity to provide Service calls. However, when the parent Activity is destroyed, the Service will end with it, thus logging the user out of Ventrilo. This will not occur on orientation changes because of the isFinished() boolean Google so thoughtfully provided for us. Also added in some Notifications, including users logging in or out, leaving or joining your channel, and incoming pages (which vibrate - side note: added vibration permissions to the Manifest). Testing connection stability and battery life overnight.
