* wip

* need to test more thoroughly

Should work,
Should also push off the resync to only be at the chapter level, genesis
at near completion takes a while to resync

* should fix the issue

Threads from the thread pool were not deallocating - needed to set a
timeout

DrawThread was starting twice, currently calling finish on the first
before creating the second. Need to find why it's instantiated twice.

* Jbs further improve resync (#763)

* if something is wrong, then resync

Looks if the db does not have a record for something in the file system
before doing a resync at the chapter or project level

always resync the units (should mostly be in sync, and doesn't take a
while to do compared to the other levels)

Still some cleanup to do

* Fixes issue #757

crashed due to trying to access an element in an empty array, added a
check for size in addition to null

* reorganize

* Changed project resync

Project resync now resyncs the entire tR directory if a discrepency is
found in which projects are expected vs available.

* write done at beginning of file before exit (#782)

in order to know that the visualization thread correctly finished, I
write 4 bytes of zeros at the beginning of the file. Then, before
finishing writing the file, I seek back and write 'D' 'O' 'N' 'E' in
bytes.

Loading the visualization file then needs to check the first four bytes.

* Opening empty chapter crashes (#783)

Opening an empty chapter crashes because of the resync trying to get the
chapterId of a chapter that does not exist.

* corrected check for section markers (#793)

Was checking if the mark and limit had changed; but this check was wrong
if the limit was set to the end of the file.

Now checking with the markerholder if it was actually set.

Also, re-posting the call to swap in the visualization file via a
handler, because the call can theoretically happen before the visualizer
has been created from the VTO callback.

* Stop audio playback when leaving playback activity

audio would continue playing after leaving the playback screen; this
will pause it when the activity finishes

* Jbs bugfix scroll time (#795)

* updating time on scroll

scrolling the minimap was not calling an update to the fragments
containing a timer.

* Elapsed time maintained on mode switch

Elapsed time was being set to zero when fragments swap; now they are
initialized correctly to the current location.

* Bugfix: sort markers

wasn't using the sorted list to write markers to the file

* jan25b

* Bugfix: Adding the same project

Prevents the user from adding the same project; Issues can come up if
this is done but with a different recording mode (chunk vs verse)

* v1.0.0 Beta

* Bugfix: chapter resync crashing on invalid names

chapter folders that do not parse to integers cause crashes, this fix
skips over them.

Also fixed a lingering issue from swapping the end verse from -1 for
verses/chunks to the start verse.

* update version

* fix detection of recording mode (#809)

* fix detection of recording mode

some chunks only have one verse, in which that particular filename cannot determine whether or not the file is a part of a chunk or verse project. Now checking metadata for this information.

* bugfix

intended parameter order to be different

* other issue with parameter order

adding take after a cut also had the parameters mixed up.

* fixed marker behavior on cut (#813)

Markers in a cut are removed

Otherwise, markers are remapped to the correct relative location after
cuts and undo.

* Bugfix: parsing metadata loop

if a limit is set on a buffer, the position will never hit the capacity,
and the while loop will never exit

* Bugfix #815

placing a start marker and moving it without having placed an end marker
will attempt to get the X position of a non-existent end marker.

Solved by checking if the marker exists first

* Jbs line at end (#849)

* Small fixes

Checking if start position + increment is within the accessor's size
results in cutting off early if the capacity is inside this range.
Results in the line SOMETIMES showing up and SOMETIMES not

Also, a rounding error can prevent skipping the last index of a cut,
which can result in rendering values that should be inside of a cut.

* build warning fix

fixes the compiler warnings due to zip4j

some dex stuff was recommended and took care of a few of the issues, but
the proguard rules turned out to fix everything so the dex stuff was
commended out. links to the stack overflow pages are in the comments

* mapping error

Click at the end related to mapping some of the metadata. Length
parameter for the file map is not the index to stop at, but the length
from the offset provided; so adding the header length to the end is only
going to map the first 44 bytes of metadata

* rename stream variables

shouldn't have been fis to begin with, temp changed to bos

* wip

* wip

* wip

* should fix concurrent access exception

cut operations that remove multiple verse markers had previously thrown
a concurrent access exception; had to do with iterating over the
collection and removing, rather than creating a list to loop over.

* insert and mapped visualization fix

insert needed to switch to relative frame (because a cut will be written
before the insert takes place) and was originally absolute time.

visualization file was accidentally swapping in the raw audio file and
not the visualization file.

* cleanup

* psa fix for database resync (#848)

getParentDirectory was not getting the 3 digit chapter folder required
for the book of psalms

project replaced by  anthology for consistency

* cleanup

minimap now uses frames rather than time, uses the handler to submit the
call to switching from uncompressed to compressed (so as not to happen
between draw calls), makes sure that the minimap invalidation is
synchronized and cannot happen between draws

* 1.0.5-test4

* wip to check if rounding helped (#857)

* 1.0.5 beta

* Fix intent

Lingering problem from having changed the package name- the intent sent
throught the preference screen still used the old package

* Hide Keyboard/menu on source audio activity

Pressing back from the file picker or selecting a tr file results in
re-engaging the search bar and opening the keyboard.

The search bar only makes sense when the language list is open. Opening
the language list and selecting the item sets whether the search menu
should be visible and invalidates the menu forcing a redraw- this keeps
me from having to store a reference to the menu (which is probably a bad
idea).

* Close keyboard on Settings page

Keyboard should now close when the source language is selected from the
settings page.

Back button fixed (wasn't overriding the correct back button)

Hiding the search menu item similar to the last commit. Instanceof check
seems to be necessary, the fragment is sometimes not correct?

* marker calculation incorrect

marker indexes into the hashmap for the waveform fragment counted down
from 0 so it would replace the first verse, now the index is the actual
verse number.

* Change sorting

Sorting is now based on take number, rather than last modified.

Adding verse markers to a file will change the last modified time, which
will result in it being placed at the end of the list on the unit card,
which would make it appear that the file was lost since the take number
on the unit card will then refer to a different file

a refactor like the playback activity did however.

related to attempting to remove a dialog?

The bug report was caused by a null pointer exception, that appears to
ultimately be as a result of a wav file not being recorded due to the OS
not being able to open it during the recording phase.

Up to this point, the file should only be interacted with in these two
files, where a finally block as been added to close the streams.

Additional logging statements have been included.

Unit picker's increment and decrement buttons are changed to plus and
minus icons. This change is reflected in the recording screen. The old
icons were play icon that was repurposed, which polluted the semantic
meaning of the play icon. It was also quite big that it distracts from the
main record button that's at the bottom main panel.

In the playback screen, there are more noteable changes.

Starting from the top, the minimap icon is now changed to a custom
waveform icon instead of the icon for a physical map.

The start and end marker is given dark cyan color like the one used in the
volume bar. This also to avoid having bright colors clashing everywhere on
the screen.

Secondary action buttons on the main panel are made slightly smaller to
emphasize the main actions more.

Give source audio playback and file info panel a darker background because
it's considered a ""secondary"" action. It keeps the recording panel
(containing the record button and time elapsed) and the waveform panel the
main focus of the screen.

Volume bar is given 1 solid color that changes based on decibel level. It
also has a much lower hold delay for a more accurate feedback.

Create UnitPicker ""widget"" that's basically a stripped down version of the
NumberPicker widget. This widget can be used as chapter, chunk, or verse
picker inside the app. More API (public methods) can be added in the
future as needed.

nulling the references has been moved to the thread upon exiting the
loop, requiring another flag to determine if this behavior is desired.

Furthermore, release is now happening in the onDestroy method rather
than on pause. This was causing problems when the activity was hidden
and recreated.

Also check to make sure when writing a cut that the element to access is
not out of bounds of the mapped file.

Fixed scrubbing on the minimap with a cut; getWidth needed to be casted
to a float for division, the percentage of time needed to be a
percentage of the adjusted duration not the original file duration, and
the time to seek to needed to be adjusted back to absolute time.

Drawing the end marker line on the waveform needed to reverse the
adjusted time before subtracting; in order to determine the distance

Fixed how saving works. Saving to a different name will make a new file
and the old file will be preserved (UUID from recording still cleaned
up) rather than renaming the file (and thus a ""overwrite"")

Overwriting without a cut just renames the file, but overwriting with a
cut writes to a new file and deletes the old.

Not overwriting with a cut writes to a new file.

Fixed the issue where clearing the markers would not immediately draw
the change. I wasn't calling updateUI, which needed to be done in the
playbackscreen method for clearing the markers.

Fixed the issue where playback would resume from the start of the file
upon hitting a stop marker, rather than resuming from the start marker.
This was caused in startPlaybackPosition being given time in ms rather
than the location in the file.

Fixed an issue where pressing back would cause the app to hang. This was
due to trying to take a message from a queue that wasn't issued.

Ultimately, what needed to happen was to introduce a way to distinguish
between pausing to recording (which needs recording resources cleaned up
on a back press) and pausing to playback (which needs playback resources
cleaned up).

In addition, more condition checks were introduced in the playback class
to stop issues related to operations on a null mediaplayer.

Fixes the bug where future recordings are corrupted if the user presses
back while recording is paused.

The issue came from not cleaning up resources correctly on the back
pressed due to the isRecording flag being false (due to the pause
state).

This also implies there may have been an issue cleaning up the
MediaPlayer object if playback was paused during the back press, but
this commit handles that case.

Releases the media player if the user presses the back button. This
caused an issue with playback on future recordings.

Also, placed braces around case statements in exit dialog. Checks are
done to print whether the recording service successfully stopped. Also
onBackPressed now calls onDestroy in hopes that this clears the state
of the activity to prevent issues with restarting recording after the
back button was pressed.

NOTE: I am unable to reproduce the problem now with corrupting the
playback causing future recordings to play back quickly. This used to
be reproducible by pressing back while recording, then recording again.
Keep on a lookout for this behavior.

collect all data in an array (that will overflow) and compress after
recording.

removed an unnecessary assignment
removed a debug print statement

Recording, writing, and real time recording visualizer are all now
implemented in services/threads.

An additional blocking queue was added to signify the end of file I/O
in order to prevent file access before the writing thread finished.

The WavVisualizer is now a member of the CanvasView, this makes more
sense from an organizational standpoint.

Adding the ability to visualize recording is now as easy as calling
canvas.listenForRecording(current activity). Note that this should only
be done once per active recording.

Loading a waveform to a canvas can be done by
canvas.loadWaveFromFile(absolute file path), then
canvas.displayWaveform(seconds), where seconds is the number of seconds
to display across the canvas. Setting this to 0 will show the entire
waveform in the canvas.
