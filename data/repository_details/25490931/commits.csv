Fixed bugs with network play. Now have a network player working. There were
a few bugs that occured after network play started working. There was a crash
on playing a skip card, and a bug with hitting on players phases that caused
both of the player's phases to be the same. This issue would also have
occured on the local game only but we could never get a computer to phase.
These are both fixed now. The only issues left for network play I believe are
that the laid Phases aren't being updated correctly... If a phase is hit on
the remote player does not see this. I have no idea why. I will look into
this.

I have structured and built most of the files that we need for making the
game. Most of the main files are here and will compile and allow you to run
the game on the tablet. They are mostly dumbie classes for not now with not
to much in them. It will all compile though and you should be able to get
past the main starting point of the app. This allows for tests to be built
and to run on the code that you are making. A test package has also been made
so that everyone can test their classes as they go. It should be all set up
correctly and pointing at the correct things. Model your test classes after
the ond that's already in there.
Good luck guys, and lets hope it goes smoothly. Let me know if you have any
questions.

I have started to work on the basics that will be needed for the game. I have
created a Hand class that will be used to hold the cards in a users hand.
This class is not done, as it will probably inherit from Deck and deck will
be modified to contain more methods or something of the like. At this point I
am unsure. I have also created a PhaseState class. It currently has nothing
in it, as I needed the support classes before I could build much. I have also
edited all of the files in the edu/up.cs301.card package so that now instead
of suites, there are colors and the ranks have been modified to have the
correct ranks for the cards, including skip and wild. The use of these will
be looked into later.

This commit is commiting the starting point for our Phase10 game. I took the
SJProj, and then went in and refactored all of the names for the packages and
files so that they all now say phase10 and all refereneces have been updated.
I left all of the files the same and it will play the SJ game so we need to
go in and basically delete all of those files under the phase10 package but
I left them there for now incase people wanted to get an idea of how Vegdahl
structured his game to start with. There may be some things that can be
reused, but soon I will just delete all files specific to the game and we'll
start over from just the framework.

the deck or the discard pile.
