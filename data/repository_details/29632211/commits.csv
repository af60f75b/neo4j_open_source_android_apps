The location provider is now chosen based on which provider gives the best
accuracy (instead of just what provider the system thinks is best
according to a set of given criteria). Also the filenames now contain a
bit more than just the date for identification.

Adds and remedies various things.
- The log space time and flush button now work (the flush should have a
  confirm though)
- The header row is now its own view so that it doesnt get flushed and has
  to be recreated all the time, in addition to being anchorede to the top
  (which is way neater than the old way of displaying it)
- The location module has been extracted to a separate class, the add new
  entry to a separate method

Can now get location and time. Time needs to be presented differently,
location seems unprecise (should probably find a way to ditch
lastKnownLocation and use current instead, but it's getting a bit late
today, so perhaps some other day).

The table would go behind the trigger button if it got too long. Now it
will not show behind the button, but still be scrollable in the way
intended.

Just occurred to me: Row fonts should perhaps be a bit larger, and the
rows should have a little bit more spacing between them. (In addittion to
the other features to distinguish them that were tought of.) As of now
there are more important things to fix, so this might be future simons
problem.

Inflating xml-templates turned out to be much better than trying to
generate view-objects purely in java code. Trying with many rows and
forcing data that is not good looking as text inherrently into the view
neatly seem to be the next steps.

Project is quite messy at this point, but backup is needed, and should be
online. The purpose of this project is to record snapshots of position and
time with sufficient precision for a part of our masters thesis. At the
moment there are buttons, an upopulated table, and great plans. Maybe
someday history will look neat and this text will not exist any more.
