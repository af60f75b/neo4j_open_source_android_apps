1952442a1e080709f31399c9c0d1268c3affa808,v2.0rc-3,"Version 2.0 Third Release Candidate

This version fixes the only issue found in v2.0rc-2, being a bug in how the application interprets strings which represent complex numbers.

This version does not have any significant impediments that I know of that might preclude its release as v2.0. Therefore, this is the version on which terminal testing will be conducted for the release.

If no significant issues are found, the complex branch will be merged with master, the versioning will be updated, and the result will be released as the v2.0 release.

Fixes a number of pesky bugs that messed up several functions of the calculator, including the arc-trigonometry functions, the exponentiation function, and the persistent bug that caused the appearance of result propagation in calculator parameters.

Because this was the only remaining open bug as of v2.0a-2 and all issues found or opened during the update process were fixed, this release does not contain any known bugs. Therefore, it shall hereby become a beta release. If no issues arefound, it shall be released as-is.

This version fixes several bugs with the v2.0 build which interfered with the correct function of the application.

There is, at the moment, only one remaining issue left. That issue is the ongoing issue with calculations seeming to propagate results despite being clear.

It is possible that it does not occur with the changes made or that it only occurs on unclean builds (which I never release), so if it doesn't show up soon the build will be declared a beta.

THIS VERSION WILL HAVE PROBLEMS. It will have numerous bugs, which might interfere with correct results, and it might even have crashes. It has been tested so that common operations on real numbers have correct results, at least when such results are obvious. Use it at your own risk: For real usage, any non-alpha version will be more suitable.

044741f61fd94c297175717ccc84cf4de1756210,v2.0,"Version 2.0: Complex numbers release

After a long development process, it is finally here. Version 2.0, the much awaited release whose pre-release builds are more numerous than all releases in the 1.x series, has arrived.

Version 2.0 expands the set of numbers the calculator can work with from the set of real numbers (representable by a double) to the set of complex numbers (whose real and imaginary parts are representable by a double apiece). All operations support both complex inputs and outputs (therefore, for example sqrt(-1) no longer generates ""Error: Complex result""), with the exception of Prime?, which only functions with real numbers. A new operation, ""Is a Gaussian Prime?"" checks for gaussian primality, which is the equivalent for complex numbers - however, not all prime numbers are Gaussian primes.

Smaller improvements over v1.2.1 include better support for Android TV and certain tablets, with better use of the dual-pane layout, an optimizing build process which significantly shrinks the APK size, and default values for operations where the default value of 0 generated a divide-by-zero error (divide, divide from, and remainder).

This is a momentous step in the development of this application, and the fruit of many hours of work, so with this release I will be taking a short break from adding new features. Github does list several issues which shall be fixed to make the v2.1 release, which I will start working on after said break.

That said, I will continue fixing bugs if any are found and reported to me. Bugfix releases, released as v2.0.1, will be released whenever available.
