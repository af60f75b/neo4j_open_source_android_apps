After changing cards listing update to send animated modifications with dispatchUpdatesTo(Adapter) in https://github.com/franciscojunior/Vampidroid/commit/fe3021291244e2b35a9fa2eeab3e180c5d7265c8 when the cards images folder is changed, this isn't reflected in the listing.
This is caused by the fact that the listing isn't refreshed anymore. And so, the images aren't reloaded. Now, when the folder is changed, force a full refresh so the images are reloaded from the new folder.
In order to do that, CardsViewModel now makes available an Observable (getNeedRefreshCardImages()) which emits whenever this folder is changed so the application can react accordingly.

The previous getNeedRefreshFlag Observable which was also used to emit whenever both the folder was changed and the preference for search inside the text card was changed was replaced by the getNeedRefreshCardsListing which only emits when the preference is changed and the cards listing needs to be refreshed. Not related to the images folder.

Add tests for those Observables

If the cache was cleared (maybe because of a low memory situation) those imageviews will have references to BitmapDrawables which have references to recycled bitmaps. This happened when those BitmapDrawables were evicted from the cache.

In this case, clear the imageViews drawables (BitmapDrawable) references. This is needed because we are loading the bitmap drawables using asynctask in a backgrond thread. This means the UI thread may try to draw the imageViews (which have the recycled bitmap reference) before we can load the new BitmapDrawables crashing the application.

 BadgeView adds a framelayout surrounding the view it adds a badge to. This was giving problems to the other views which used the filter icon to position themselves inside the layout. In this case, the filter cards imageview was surrounded by a framelayout. This way the other views in the layout could use this added framelayout to position themselves and thus, free the filter imageview to be manipulated by the BadgeView.

setImageBitmap creates a new BitmapDrawable and calls setImageDrawable.
