Now KPNFC takes you to a read activity when launched if a database is
already present.

Reading the card is also slightly more flexible -- if a smartcard
without NDEF is presented while the app is foregrounded, it will attempt
to use the KPNFC applet on the card.

It seems that Google / application providers still aren't getting this right. ACTION_GET_CONTENT is to be used for immediate access to content -- it's not intended for long-term access (and in fact Google Drive won't give you a persistable grant when you use ACTION_GET_CONTENT). ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT is for longer-term access to the data.

 Unfortunately most content providers don't implement the Storage Access Framework and thus don't support ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT. Dropbox, for example, only supports ACTION_GET_CONTENT. The URI thus returned happens to be accessible across reboots, but this isn't a guarantee and, more importantly, is not supported by Google Drive (there appears to be no way to get persistent access to a URI returned by ACTION_GET_CONTENT from Google Drive).

  So for the moment I'm using ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT and waiting for content provider authors to support the SAF.

This adds support for JavaCard 2.1-compatible contactless smartcards running the KeePassNFC applet. If the NFC tag contains the applet, then the encryption key will be written to the smartcard securely. If the NFC tag does not run the applet (e.g. it's a simple read/write NDEF tag) then everything works as previously, i.e. the encryption key will be written to the tag in the clear.

Removed dependency on external file chooser in favour of the system file chooser.

KP Droid now supports URIs in Intents, when previously it only supported files. This is great news because Android content providers communicate using URIs, so we can now pass the locations of files which aren't on the device (such as Google Drive files) to KP Droid.
