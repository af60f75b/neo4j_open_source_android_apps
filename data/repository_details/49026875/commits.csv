The App Bar was creating a shadow on the Status Bar in Main Activity, due to the wrong theme being selected in the Android Manifest. Fixing this and tweaking the theme to use the AppCompat.Light.NoActionBar theme (adhering to the Material Design Support Library tutorial here: https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2014/10/appcompat-v21-material-design-for-pre.html) fixed the issue.

Previously the exception was thrown when we verified the page we were on was not the UPassBC page, however if you enter the wrong credentials it shouldn't even get that far. Instead, the page won't have the redirect forms, and so we will get an index exception when we try and get the form from the translinkRedirect. This case is now being handled, and thrown as an authentication exception.

The checkbox input on the UPassBC page has a hidden element beside it, holding the value ""false"". Mechanize was adding this false value to the value array of the checkbox element when constructing the parameters to pass with the POST request, causing the Translink server to think we did not check any box, even when we did. Not sure why this hidden element exists, I suspect it might be an intricacy to make some JS magic work that Mechanize can't understand, hence the issue.

To fix it, remove this hidden element before submitting, so we don't add the value to the params in the request.

Hallelujah!
