can be used to update the string rendered by the
Render3dTextComponent.

For entities that wish to have the score rendered on them,
they can use the graph `src/rawassets/graphs/string.json`.
This graph concatenates a string consisting of the current
score, using the new node in `src/modules/ui_string.cpp`,
every frame and updates the Render3dTextData appropriately.

Currently, the font used by FlatUI is the same as the font
used for the menu: `RaviPrakash-Regular.ttf`.

CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR and CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR were being used to
reference source files or cmake project files relative to the project's
directory.  Instead CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR should be used so that it's
possible to reference source files relative to the CMakeLists.txt file
in the project.

All generated files still reference CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR so they're placed
in the directory used for builds.

Tested:
Verified all targets in this project continue to build on OSX.

I *think* (it's hard to reproduce) this fixes the occasional messed
up camera position when the game finishes.

There were a couple of issues:
* The motivator used to look-ahead the river spline in order to smooth
  raft orientation was not having it's playback rate reset so the raft
  orientation and the look-ahead orientation could end up being wildly
  different resulting in some pretty odd slerping between quaternions.
* As the playback rate ends up at zero the angle between quaternions
  tends to zero yielding bad results from the slerp.

Tested:
Verified no black screen occurs at the end of the game on
OSX and Android.

The code in the Game class's destructor was unnecessary because those
clean up functions are already getting called implicitly in their
respective class's destructors. They were also causing problems on
Windows during shutdown.

Also added a missing cast to rail_denizen.cpp.

Tested on Windows and Linux.

On OS X, when quitting with command-Q the game would crash because one
thread would end while the other was still running. Rather than quit
immediately when command-Q is entered, the game_exiting_ variable gets
set to true so that the game update thread can see that it should quit.
Without this, the other thread keeps running while the game is shutting
down.

Tested on Linux, OS X and Android.

Removed the *DataRef (e.g. TransformDataRef) edge types. They didn't
actually save us any memory or speed things up at all, and they only
made the graphs more complicated. Things that used to take a *DataRef
now just take entities instead.

A lot of graphs had redundant nodes or nodes responding to events they
shouldn't, and this would cause errors like incrementing the target
score sometimes when it shouldn't. These have been cleaned up.

Also changed the sound effects on sushi to only play when the speed of
the collision exceeds an arbitrary threshold so that we don't get a
machine gun sound any time they land on the ground. It still happens to
an extent when sushi bounces around a lot rapidly, but it's not nearly
as bad as before.

Raft now reaches a maximum playback rate of 0.9 on
the spline railtrack. Previous max speed was 2.0.
This should make the Cardboard experience more
comfortable.

Of course, a slower raft makes the game easier, so
to counter we do two things.

(1) Patrons disappear more quickly as time progresses.
They no longer hang around until the pop-out radius.
There's a amount of time that they'll hang around,
if they're ignored (i.e. not tossed some sushi).
After that time, they'll go away. This amount of time
decreases as the game goes on. It's configured
differently, per patron.

(2) Start the required score at 24 instead of 20
(achievable by average first-time players), and increase
the required score by 3 instead of 2 each lap.

Good players should be able to complete 4 laps, and then
end at the end of the 5th lap. This still feels a bit
long, since the laps take a lot longer to finish now.
We can look, at some point, into adding extra gates or
shrinking the track.

Sometimes new lap events would not fire due to how the math was being
done. The math for the spline has been simplified an no longer makes a
call to floor(). The issue was that if the spline progress percentage
was exactly 1.0, it would get added to floor(previous_percent). Because
this value is larger than the previously seen value, it would not call
the new lap event.

I've tested this on Android and Linux and it definitely doesn't make
anything worse, but because this bug is so inconsistent it's hard to
verify that it's no longer happening.

Our model of ""use all remaining uniform registers for bones""
was flawed, because its very difficult to calculate how many
uniform registers are being used. I calculated the correct
amount for our test devices, but other devices (Nexus 10,
Samsung S6) allocate registers differently and required
more.

This resulted in them giving us a giant bone_transforms array,
but running out of uniform registers for shaders.

Better to keep things simple. Only allocate bone_transforms[]
for the number of bones that we have. If another application
requires more, they can increase the size of the
bone_transforms array as required.

Tested: Works on Linux and Nexus 10.

Previously, the game would only ever start rendering at the start
of a vsync cycle.  Now if it misses a frame window, it starts
rendering the next frame immediately, rather than waiting for the
next vsync event.  Results in potentially better recovery from
interference (other android processes needing CPU time) and
generally better framerates overall.

Tested on N5 and N6.  Significantly improves the framerate on
the nexus 5 in cardboard mode.

Android has a CPU governor that will try to lower CPU clock speeds
if it thinks the user hasn't been interacting with the device.
Simulating touch events lets it know that the user is still active,
even though most of actual input is being handled via motion
sensors.  This keeps the  CPU frequencies higher, and keeps our
framerates much more stable.

Also added a histogram that prints out performance data every 5
seconds about our framerates.

Fixes problem where we'd kick out of Cardboard

when the button is pressed

Also attempts to draw attention to the score
sign at the end of the game, since the bird is
the last to disappear and is right on top of the
sign.

Added concept of events to the patrons.
When an event is triggered, the patrons will execute
a series of animations.

Since the 'w' row of the mat4 for 'bone_transforms' is always a
constant (0, 0, 0, 1), it is not essential for the 'bone_transforms'
array. Therefore, we can use an array of vec4's that contain only
the essential information, and then use a helper function to add

03edb27e43c1b44c19ae347082cb5bb0a10bfb57,03edb27e,Improve sushi trajectory.,"Improve sushi trajectory.

Sushi's initial position was tied to the player's position,
but the axes were swapped. This meant that when you looked up,
the sushi would be launched upside down--something no decent
sushi chef would do. Now the sushi is always launched upright.

The sushi rotation was also always similar: it would always
rotate with backspin, clockwise, and forward. Now the rotation
direction is randomized.

We rotate less in the pitch and yaw directions now. This keeps
the sushi more upright for longer, as you would hope for in a
sushi restaurant.

victory and failure chime that plays when a lap is complete to make it
more obvious that something happened when you finish a lap.

The scoreboard now displays both the current score and the target score.

The score board has been moved to the right side. Since we're moving
clockwise around the course, you're more likely to be looking to the
right than to the left, so this makes it easier to see.

Added a 100's digit to the scoreboard, since getting a score that high
isn't that unreasonable.

Due to how we sort meshes for the alpha pass, I had to put in a hack to
get the digits to render correctly. Meshes are sorted based on the
distance from the camera to the entity, so I moved the digit entities
forward and made the digit meshes pushed back slightly. This ensures
the digits do not clip the sign they're supposed to be on.

Missed this one in my last pass - the midground trees had a
completely empty culling mask, so they were never being culled
based on distance or view angle.  Making them a constant tax
on our rendering, whether you could see them or not.

Gave them a culling mask so they behave like other trees.

How rail denizen data inherited transforms had issues with the editor,
as it was accumulating the tranform data into the offset data, so every
reload from the editor essentially doubled the position the offset was
using. Fixed this by splitting the offset and the transform data,
and undoing the rail changes when entering the editor.

Tested on Linux, iterating with the editor.

I've added a hack to get the code to run on VS2012,

if the implementation of std::vector::push_back uses
in-place creation (like Clang) or copy creation (like VS).

Also note that Clang seems to choose the intrinsically
generate the move constructor first. VS intrinsically generates
the copy constructor first. Regardless of which is compliant,
it would be nice if our code supported both without resorting
to hacks such as the one in this change.

On the update thread, we called Input::AdvanceFrame(), which then calls
SDL_PollEvent() in order to processes OS messages.

However, from the SDL documentation on SDL_PollEvent():
(https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_PollEvent)
""As this function implicitly calls SDL_PumpEvents(), you can only call
this function in the thread that set the video mode.""

So, we have to move the Input::AdvanceFrame() call to the render thread,
unfortunately.

The issue was caused by the dependency the source files had on the
generated files. Because of this, checking the generated files would
make it as newer, thus forcing all the source files to need to be
rebuilt.

This can be prevented with order-only prerequisites, which lets the
files depend on the generated files being checked first, but not have
the act of checking them be enough to consider them newer.

in the long term both the RaftEntityNode and PlayerEntityNode should go
away and be replaced by a more general entity node, but this was quick
and easy and does what I need for now.

Made some minor adjustments to the logical operator nodes so that they
fire void events when they become true and when they become false,
rather than just having a boolean output. This will be useful for
setting up logic like ""When the timer is less than X *and* when the
player's score is less than Y, then end the game.""

A graph component has been added which can hold an arbitrary number of
graphs. Graphs are referenced by filename, and are currently executed
once per frame. Eventually these will also be hooked up to the world,
and also possibly to physics components.

Modules for basic logic, math, debugging, vector math, string
manipulation, audio, and entities have been added. All modules can be
found in the src/modules folder. Not all of the nodes are used yet, many
of them were added because they seemed like they would just be useful to
have. A handful of them are tested in test.json.

Added graph_factory.cpp/h, which just contains a set of functions used
to load graphs from data. Once this has seen some use, it should be
generalized and moved into the event system library.

Updated build_assets.py to compile graph json files into .graph files.

Position and orientation are adjusted to catch sushi.

The catch position is calculated from the sushi's
trajectory. We only move the patrons along the plane,
never jump them in the air. This means that sometimes
the patrons must move backwards or forwards so that
the sushi doesn't soar over them.

Probably makes the game too easy at the moment.
We'll make later changes to slow down the top
speed.

Previously the croc and bird would face mostly backwards.
This was awkward because the new movement logic
assumed that angle 0 for a character means forwards.

This change rotates the croc prototype to have angle 0
being forward, and counter-rotates all the instantiations
accordingly.

Also, move the contact regions to match, and expand the
contact reagion so that the croc can eat from both sides.

that a lot of sounds were being played at 0,0,0.

Added the new sound effects and ambiance and removed most of the old
sound effects.

Changed the Patron so that they can react to multiple different
collision events. Events are differentiated by an arbitrary tag placed
on them when they occur. Rather than have a single on_collide ActionDef,
they have a list of possible on_collision actions that are tagged, and
only the matching action is executed. e.g. Hitting the mouth will create
a collision tagged with ""Mouth"", which will then execute the ""Mouth""
ActionDef. In the long term, we want to move this on_collision behavior
to the physics component itself, but that currently requires hoisting a
bunch of code out of Zooshi and into the Event system, so I'll do that
in a seperate checkin. b/22847175

Hooked up the audio engine to a few states so that sounds could play on
state transitions. This would be better handled through the event
system, but that plumbing isn't hooked up yet. b/22851325

 Tweaked the distance the shadow starts from the actual surface.
 (Needs to be >0 to prevent the shadow from clipping through in
 the wrong direction due to rounding errors.)  I had erred on the
 side of caution because of loss of precision on mobile, but now
 that the mobile shadowmaps are no longer losing precision, this
 can go back to the original value.

 Also lowered the shadowmap resolution, resulting in slightly
 blockier shadows, but slightly improved (~1-2 ms) framerate.

Added a pause menu state, and changed the game state transitions so that
hitting back or escape brings you to the pause menu during the game (and
exits the game from the main menu).

Cleaned up the Components flatbuffer schema by removing the old
deprecated fields. Also added a WorldDef that contains all the data
needed for setting up the game world. It's currently just a list of file
names to load entity definitions from.

* Added shadowmapping to rendermesh
* Wrote shadowmapping shaders
* Removed blob-shadows
* Made RenderMesh.currently_hidden way more efficient
* Patrons that are laying down now hide.
* Moved responsibility for rendering the scene out of rendermesh
  and into a new class, WorldRenderer.
* Exposed some functionality of rendermesh to allow finer grain
  control of what gets drawn to the screen.

Note - There is a fair amount of shadow-acne on android at the

Also refactor out the entity factory into a more generic class that can
handle not knowing about the components flatbuffer.

Also moved the first several components we will be putting into the
component library into base_components.fbs.

As of now, neither the world editor nor the components themselves
need to know anything about the specific Flatbuffer table type you are
using for loading component data. Everything is abstracted away by
the EntityFactory; you must subclass it and overwrite a few specific
functions to tell the entity factory how to read and write your data.

This is another prerequisite to making a standard component library.

The raft is now a separate entity from the player, and their
orientations are now property composed. This turned out to be a little
bit bigger of a change than I intended because a few other things were
expecting the raft and the player to be the same entity, and also
because the projectiles could no longer rely on the player's orientation
and position to be in world space, so helper functions were written to
transform an entity's local position (relative to their parent) into
world space.

Added a new StateMachine class for handling the various states the game
can be in. Currently there are just two: Gameplay and editor. Eventually
more will be added. This new organization scheme is not perfect, but it
is an improvement over what we have now.

The GameState class has been split into three seperate classes: World,
which represents all the entities and the data that's associated with
their behavior and appearance; GameplayState, which has a pointer to a
world and handles updating the game each frame; and WorldEditorState,
which handles editing the world.

The WorldEditor code no longer needed an is_active_ boolean, so that was
removed.

This is a pretty large change to how events are piped around the game.
Rather than have events that represent certain kinds of events that
happened in game (like patrons getting hit), there are events for
different kinds of actions you want to take.

To that end, PatronHit events have been removed and been replaced with
AttributeModification events. Also a ChangeRailSpeed event has been
added, but it is nonfunctional until Motive supports applying a scale to
a spline.

Added an ActionDef schema which represents an action that can be taken
in response to an event. These ActionDefs have been hooked up in various
locations in the config file, such as on patrons and physics objects so
that they can be broadcast when appropriate.

Added a ParseAction function that can turn the ActionDef into an actual
action object given the current context and passes it to the event
manager to be handled.

Also changed the name of the score component to attribute component.

Tested on Linux and Android.

Previously, calls to RegisterComponent required that you add the type of
the argument, like so:

  entity_manager_.RegisterComponent<TransformComponent>(&transform_component_);

This changes RegisterComponent to take an argument of type T instead of
type ComponentInterface, which means the argument type can be derived by
the call. It's also still required to inherit from ComponentInterface
because the helper function that's called immediately has a
ComponentInterface* as it's argument.

This also means you can't accidentally introduce a mismatch between a
component object and its type when calling the function (e.g. you can no
longer call `RegisterComponent<FooComponent>(bar_component)` by mistake).

requiring an event ID when broadcasting an event shouldn't be necessary,
so I removed that requirement. You can now just call
`event_manager->BroadcastEvent(EventType(...))` and it will work.
Additionally, if you want to send an event to a specific listener, you
can use `listener->SendEvent(EventType(...))`. The listener must still
override the OnEvent(const EventPayload&)` so that they can switch based
on the payload's event id.

Also did some minor clean up on the events that have already been
written to make their names less verbose and more consistent.

After several conversations, ComponentData seems to be the more
intuitive name for the data a component associates with a
specific entity.

Should be a straight rename - no logic was changed.

Hierarchical transforms are being moved into the transform class,
rather than being their own separate thing.  In addition, world
transform data is being calculated separately from the render
step.  (Which should allow for better options for multithreading.)

This also means that there no longer need to be empty rendermesh
components on non-rendering nodes in an entity hiearchy.  (As a
result, the ability to handle empty data has been removed from
rendermeshcomponent, and it will throw an assert if you try to
use it without specifying a mesh.)

Event listeners may register themselves with an event manager and all

of the EventManager, but this can change in the future if we find a
better organizational method.

The copy and move constructors were not set up correctly, causing them
to point at freed memory when copied around in, for example,
std::vectors. I've added a move constructor and disallowed copying
because copying an intrusive list doesn't really make sense.

Also removed the TypedIntrusiveList version of the class since we're not
using it, and I'd like to simplify things.

Tested on Linux. Can't test on windows because of a bunch of other
breakages, but my reasearch suggests this will work on the versions of
MSVC we support.

This adds the ExportRawData function to the component interface. Any

for use in an editor) should implement this function to export its
data. It can later re-import the data via the existing AddFromRawData
function.

This also includes a sample implementation for TransformData.

Player input is now routed via the BasePlayerController class,
which maps inputs from some other source (usually the input
manager) and converts them into generic logical inputs that the
game can consume, without having to care about where they were
generated.

Added a controller for basic mouselooking, and a controller for
cardboard-style android movement.

Also cleaned up some function signatures.

Tested on Android and Linux.

Added a simple cube mesh, to show the pipeline is working.
We'll eventually delete the cube mesh.

The pipeline requires that you manually add material.json
files. For example, we have to manually add cube__guy.json,
for the texture cube__guy.png, which gets pulled out of
the source model cube.fbx. It would be nicer if the
pipeline automatically determined the material format and
created cube__guy.json, but for now this is what we have.

player component, which is currently empty but will represent any player
character in the world.

Additionally, the game class loads the config file and takes the first
component it finds and uses it's rail denizen component to drive the
camera. This will change in the future.

Functions to draw white boxes have also been added so that we have some
dummy scenery for development.

Note: There is an issue with motivators that causes the game to crash
after the camera has moved a certain distance. A fix for this will be
checked in shortly, but I wanted to check in the work that I've done so

Changed the world coordinates.  Before, the XZ plane represented
the ground, and Y represented height, and the coordinates system
was left-handed.  Now, the XY plane representes the ground, and
Z represents height, and it is right-handed.

Also, included a basic game-camera class to track camera postion.

Not much of a game yet.  Just an animated texture with music.
But should be a good starting point - contains texture/shader
loading, rendering, input, and sound.
