Although most games filter out various forbidden characters, this is
done using the ""keydown"" event, which means that characters entered
by pasting are not filtered. To solve this problem, a function has been
added to MG_GAME_API (preventEvents()) which can be used to prevent
pasting, copying, etc. In addition, calls to this function have been
added to each individual game.

After the change to multiword parsing (commit 7453f3b9), it became much

the same code that ZenTag uses, with some slight modifications. This
limits the characters that can be entered in the text area to just
letters (a-z, A-Z).

Multiword tags are split to create additional single-word tags. These
single-word tags are only saved in the database - they are not returned
to the user and do not affect their score.

When tags are submitted from a game, they are expected to either be an
array of tags, or a string separated by commas or double quotes ("").
The two symbols are treated equivalently, so matching quotes is not
necessary.

Known issues:
 - GuessWhat does not have client-side character filtering, making it
   possible to give multiword hints. This bug is more evident with the
   changes to tag parsing. It should be easily solvable using a list
   of forbidden characters like ZenTag or StupidRobot.

and then the final screen was immediately shown (either by time limit or by

This was due to an HTML element ID conflict between the in-game and final

""endgameMessage"", resolving the issue.

Adds an in-game score display to accompany the StupidRobot scoring algorithm.
Note that the two are completely independent - while it is possible to falsify
the in-game display, it will not affect the overall scoreboard.

As a part of adding the score display, the HTML structure of the final screen
has been redone, removing the questionable use of <span> elements and
line breaks, and replacing them with a table. This also allows for easy
alignment of the score counters with their respective words. In addition, the
empty 11- to 13-letter word spaces remaining from an earlier revision have now
been removed entirely.

Aesthetic changes will likely be made to the display before merging this branch
back into the development branch, but the functionality is finished. In
addition, there is a known bug where the display will sometimes not animate;
this is an inconsistent problem and the cause is not yet known.

This commit fixes the StupidRobot code intended to cut to the end-screen early

seven words, they would have to wait for the timer to run out or click ""Quit""
to continue.

Specifically, it fixes a conditional (acceptedWords > maxLevel) to be
(acceptedWords > maxLevel - 4) because the user cannot enter 1, 2, or 3-letter
words.

Other changes:
 - Changed definition of maxLevel in re_init to 10.
   The re_init function is intended to reset various game constants to their
   initial values. However, the maxLevel in re_init was not changed from 13 to
   10 when the original constant was. This meant that in subsequent games,
   players could type longer words, although they would not be accepted.
   (This also caused problems with the conditional mentioned above.)

This addresses issue MDG-96: GAME SERVER - mgg: Error 500 when trying to access Tag page.

""Error 500
include(collection.php): failed to open stream: No such file or directory""

Issue is that filenames are case-sensitive, so
so change collection::model() to Collection::model()

This may also explain why this wasn't seen when testing on
development environments where names are case-insensitive.

This commit adds NLP plugin components written by Etai. We've added
some documentation about installing NLTK corpora and implemented
Yii-style relative paths to the python files.

The WordCheck Plugin is currently in place, but we haven't fully
tested the Stemming plugin yet, so its php file is stashed under
extensions/ for now (so that nobody can enable it accidentally!)

The WordCheck Plugin isn't super-speedy, but there might be some ways
to speed up the plugin via caching or external processing.

We've sporadically seen an error on some systems (but not all) where
the user counter code has an issue with getting some variables set
from the DB properly.

We don't have a ton of time to dig through the code and figure out
exactly what's going wrong here, especially as all of the comments are
in German, so for now we're just going to not set the value
$this->user_time. The user-counter code isn't critical to game play or
other components, so we'll probably punt on this a bit longer.

Interestingly, the user counter seems to work correctly even with this
variable commented-out. Hmmm...

look at the form() function to see two strings that could easily be
programmatically based on the primary POST variable).

This commit also fixes the bug where disabling Image Export had no
effect on actually disabling the actions of the plugin.

This commit adds code to implement the PASS button for Zen Tag.

The basic idea is that when the user clicks the PASS button, we send
""__PASSONTHISTURN__"" as the tag. The internals of the tag backend (in
MGTags.php) clean that up to ""PASSONTHISTURN"" when we handle it in
other code, though -- so be wary of that.

This commit implements the little pieces necessary to ignore this tag
in scoring, when selecting tags for single-player GuessWhat, etc. The
tag does show up in the backend when selecting all tags, but as that's
just the ADMIN interface, it's fine for it to be visible there.

This commit cleans up some of the code in evaluateGuess to make it
more readable, and fixes some calls to areHintsAllowedLeft() so that
the function is properly called.

The behavior of the code seems to be correct from the standpoint of
the 'guesser', however even after we've run out of hints there's still
a message propagating back to the 'describer' that is triggering the
event for initiating the hint-giving mode. That message chain might be
important for updating the display of the 'describer' to let them know
that the 'guesser' is continuing to interact with the game (through
guesses), however we need to nip at least part of it in the bud to
prevent extra hints (and their fun but annoying negative-numbered
indicies!).

'guesses left' box above it.

This commit tweaks some of the pieces of the javascript behind hint
passing/showing so that we stop the hint countdown at zero, and don't
let the player see anymore hints.

This commit also does some cleanup and refactoring to support the
above changes.  (more similar cleanup is possible -- if we need to do
more surgery in the future).

This commit fixes some function calls to methods on XMPAppend. We
instatiate an instance of XMPAppend so that we can make calls
dynamically instead of statically.

At the heart of it, none of these functions carry state; it would make
some sense to just refactor XMPAppend (and the libraries below it) so
that we could make all of our calls statically, however because this
refactoring might reach down deeper than the XMPAppend layer, this
would take a bit of time and would make it harder to upgrade the PHP
Metadata Toolkit library in the future.

This commit fixes a bug in the PHP Metadata Toolkit code in XMPAppend
where the return value from function find_XMP_block was sometimes
'FALSE' even though the return type on the function was specified as
being a reference.

Two notes:

1) PHP should have better error handling and reporting so that it
would be more clear that the return types didn't match up.

2) This code comes directly from the PHP Metadata Toolkit library, so
we should be careful and potentially write some more (Unit) tests to
make sure that we've covered various code paths here and don't run
into similar problems again.

This commit makes several tweaks to the pieces of the XMPAppend class
to make the code properly operate on an image and append new metadata
to the 'dc:description' field.

Several of these changes are temporary and are marked as such -- we'd
like to further understand the details of why these tweaks are
necessary before we make them wholly a part of the library.

In particular, I'm curious about the bits of the template XMP array
that were preventing the XMP data from being recognized by external
programs. I need to ask Evan Hunter (the original author of the code)
about that particular structure.

This commit creates a new plugin 'TagsExportPlugin' created based on
the recommendations of Peter Carini/Joshua at Special Collections.

The plugin outputs a tab-delimited CSV file. At the top is a header
consisting of information/URLs for the project and metadata about the
date of export, version of the software, etc. All of these header
lines start with a hash (#).

After the header, there is a label line (Image Name, Tags), and then
one line for each image (with the data following the column labels).
