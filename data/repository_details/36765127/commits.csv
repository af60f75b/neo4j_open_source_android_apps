The list-certificates subcommand of the manage-certificates tool
will attempt to verify the signature for each certificate in the
keystore.  To do this, it needs to retrieve the issuer certificate,
and if it can't find that issuer certificate in the keystore, it
will report a warning.  Previously, the tool would only look for
the issuer certificate in the keystore's trusted certificate
entries, which means that it wouldn't find it if the issuer
certificate were only included in the keystore as part of the
certificate chain stored in a private key entry.  The tool will
now properly look for the issuer certificate in private key
entry certificate chains in addition to trusted certificate entries.

The check-certificate-usability subcommand also attempts to validate
the signatures of each certificate in the chain, but it was not
affected by this bug because it uses a different mechanism for
getting the issuer certificate.

* The tool will now display a little more information about a

  of the output to make a little more sense.  It will also indicate
  whether the keystore has a private key to accompany each certificate.

* The tool will now display the encoded public key for keys that it
  cannot decode on its own.

* The display-certificate-signing-request-file subcommand now offers a
  --verbose argument.  Without this argument, only summary details of

  not align with the interpretation that had previously been used.
  Further, the X.509 specification states that timestamps with years
  before 1950 or after 2049 should be encoded as generalized times
  rather than UTC times, and that has been addressed.

* Added an isSelfSigned method that can be used to determine whether
  the certificate is self-signed.

* Added an isIssuerFor method that can be used to determine whether the
  certificate is the issuer for another provided certificate,
  optionally getting the reason that the match did not succeed.

* Added a toCertificate method that can be used to convert the X.509
  certificate to a java.security.cert.Certificate object.

* The logic for decoding extensions has been moved out of the
  X509Certificate class and into the X509CertificateExtension class.

The LDAP SDK already had support for parsing strings as OIDs, and for
determining whether a string represented a valid OID.  However, this
validation was not strictly compliant with the requirements of numeric
OIDs.  In particular, a strictly valid numeric OID should also meet the
following requirements that had not previously been checked:

* It must have at least two components.
* The first component must have a value of 0, 1, or 2.
* If the first component has a value of 0 or 1, then the second
  component must not be larger than 39.

To retain backward compatibility but also provide support for strict
validation, the OID class has been updated to keep the
isValidNumericOID method as-is, but add a new isStrictlyValidNumericOID
method that performs all of the additional strict checking.

In addition, a new OIDArgumentValueValidator class has been added,
which can be added to an Argument (presumably a StringArgument) to
ensure that the argument only accept values that are numeric OIDs.
This validator can be configured to operate in either strict or
non-strict mode.

When the LDAP SDK is configured to use synchronous mode, if the call to
send a bind request message fails, the LDAP SDK could silently consume
the exception rather than propagating it back to the caller, and would
then proceed to wait for a response that won't come because the request
probably didn't get sent.  This could cause the thread to be blocked
for the entire response timeout period before an exception is thrown
back to the caller, and when that happens, the exception about a
response timeout could be misleading because the request may not have
actually been sent.

Most of the time, there should be a very low risk of getting an
exception when trying to send a message because that message will go
into the socket's transmit buffer, and it is highly unlikely that the
message is too big to fit in the transmit buffer (and because the
connection is operating in synchronous mode, it is also highly unlikely
that the transmit buffer has anything else in it).  This means that in
most cases, the call to send the bind request message will succeed
almost instantaneously and the LDAP SDK will block while waiting on
the response.  If a problem the occurs that causes the request to not
actually be sent, then the call to read the response will fail with the
details of the send failure.

However, the problem could arise if the bind request is the first
operation on a newly-established secure connection backed by an
SSLSocket in which the TLS negotiation has not yet completed.  Unlike a
regular socket, an SSLSocket will block while trying to send data over
a connection that has not yet completed TLS negotiation.  If the TLS
negotiation fails or times out, then the application wouldn't have
received any indication of a problem until after the full response
timeout period has elapsed after the problem was first detected, and
then the exception that eventually got thrown would erroneously suggest
that the problem was in not getting the expected response within an
acceptable period of time rather than failing to send the request in
the first place.

Made a few improvements to the LDAP SDK's ASN.1 support to make it
easier to work with BER types.  This includes:

* There is now an ASN1Element.getTypeClass() method, which can be used
  to retrieve a value that indicates the BER type for the element.

* There is now an ASN1Element.isConstructed() method, which can be used
  to determine whether type indicates that the element is constructed
  or primitive.

* The ASN1Constants class has a number of constants that provide
  bitmasks that can be used to extract information from the element
  type, including the class and primitive/constructed bit.  The names
  of these constants all had a typo in that they started with ""TYE_""
  when they were intended to start with ""TYPE_"".  New versions of the
  constants have been added with the correct names.  The old versions
  of the constants with the incorrect names are still there for
  backward compatibility, but they have been marked deprecated.

* The ASN1Constants.TYPE_MASK_APPLICATION_CLASS constant (formerly
  TYE_MASK_APPLICATION CLASS) had an incorrect value.  The value was
  inadvertently set to 0x04 when the correct value is really 0x40.
  This constant is not actually used within the LDAP SDK itself, so the
  incorrect value did not cause any incorrect behavior or other
  problems within the LDAP SDK, but it could have caused problems with
  any application that used the constant.

When creating an argument, you can only specify at most one long
identifier string and one short identifier character, and you have to
specify at least one of them.  However, you can also specify additional
long and short identifiers that can also be used for that argument on
the command line.  This is useful because it can make it easier for
users to request an argument without having to remember exactly what
the right identifier is.  For example, if a tool creates an LDIF file,
a user might not remember off the top of their head if they need to
specify the argument as '--ldifFile' or '--ldif-file' or '--filename'
or '--outputFile' or '--output-file'.  If the tool defines multiple long
identifiers for that argument, then the user could provide any of those
identifiers to get the desired result.  This helps make the tool more
user-friendly and convenient to use.

In the past, all of the long and short identifiers for an argument were
always included in the usage information.  This can be useful because it
ensures that the user knows all of the ways that argument can be
requested, but it can also cause the output to appear cluttered,
especially for arguments with a lot of identifiers.  To address this,
it is now possible to indicate that additional long and short
identifiers should be hidden.  This means that the tool will still
accept the provided identifier as an alternate way to request the
argument, but it won't appear in usage information.

Similarly, for tools that use subcommands, you can provide additional
names for each subcommand that can also be used to request that
subcommand.  When adding an additional subcommand, you can now indicate
whether that additional subcommand name should be hidden so that it is
still allowed on the command line but will be excluded from usage
information.

All of the command-line tools provided with the LDAP SDK have been
updated so that all additional long and short identifiers, and all
additional subcommand names, will be marked as hidden.  All of those
additional argument identifiers and subcommand names are still available
for use, but they will be excluded from usage information so that the
output is less cluttered.

Updated the command-line tool framework to add support for logging information
about the launch and completion of command-line tools to a specified file or

arguments provided on the command line, as well as the values of any arguments
obtained from a properties file, the time the command was invoked, and the
name of the account on the underlying system that launched the tool.
Completion messages will include the exit code and/or exit message, if
available (although they may not be available if the tool was interrupted
before it completed).

This functionality is primarily intended for use with Ping Identity server
products, and by default, logging will only be performed for those tools (and
also by default, only for a subset of tools that can alter server
configuration, state, or data).  However, it is possible to enable invocation
logging for any tool written with the LDAP SDK command-line tool API by
setting an environment variable or JVM property that the command-line tool
framework can use to locate a logging properties file, and by defining an
appropriate configuration in that properties file.

This commit fixes a couple of bugs in the interactive mode support for
command-line tools:

- When prompting for a file path, it is possible for File.getParentFile() to
  return null even if the file has a parent, if that the file object was
  created with just a filename rather than a full path.  To reliably get the
  parent directory, we now use File.getAbsoluteFile().getParentFile().

- Interactive mode processing did not perform dependent argument validation
  before trying to run the tool.  That has been fixed.

The in-memory directory server has been updated to provide support for working
with encoded passwords.  In the past, the in-memory directory server has
always stored passwords in the clear, with no alteration of any kind.  That is
still the default, but it is now possible to configure the server to
automatically encode new clear-text passwords using a specified mechanism, and
to support existing pre-encoded passwords using a provided set of mechanisms.

This functionality is exposed through the InMemoryDirectoryServerConfig class,
which now offers a setPasswordEncoders method that allows you to set an
optional primary password encoder (that will be used to encode any clear-text
passwords provided for storage in the server), and an optional collection of
secondary encoders (that will be used to interact with pre-encoded passwords,
but that will not be used to encode new passwords).

It is also possible to configure the set of password attributes that will be
used by the in-memory directory server.  Previously, this was hard-coded to
be userPassword, and that is still the default configuration, but you can now
use the setPasswordAttributes method to specify which attribute(s) are
intended to hold passwords.  If the server has been configured with a primary
password encoder, then any clear-text values provided for these password
attributes in an LDIF import, LDAP add request, LDAP modify request, or
password modify extended request, will be automatically encoded.  If the
server has been configured with primary or secondary password encoders, then
it can make use of those encoders to compare clear-text bind passwords against
the encoded values stored in the server.

The server provides pluggable support for password encoders via the extensible
com.unboundid.ldap.listener.InMemoryPasswordEncoder class.  Each encoder must
define a unique prefix (for example, you might use ""{SHA}"" for an encoder that
uses an unsalted SHA-1 digest), and it can also use an output formatter that
transforms the output in some way.  The server includes password encoder
implementations that leave passwords in the clear or that use a salted or an
unsalted message digest.  It also includes output formatter implementations
represent raw bytes in base64 or hexadecimal.

For support purposes, the LDAP SDK build process has the ability to obtain
information about the repository from which the source code was retrieved.
Previously, only subversion repositories were supported (using the open source
SVNKit library).  This commit adds support for git repositories (using the
open source JGit library, which depends on the open source slf4j library).

The effects of this change are:

- A new com.unboundid.ldap.sdk.Version.REPOSITORY_TYPE constant is available.
  Its value will be one of ""subversion"", ""git"", or ""{unknown}"".

- A new com.unboundid.ldap.sdk.Version.REPOSITORY_URL constant is available.
  If the LDAP SDK source code was obtained from a subversion or git
  repository, then the appropriate type of URL should be used for that type of
  repository (e.g., https://svn.code.sf.net/p/ldap-sdk/code or
  git@github.com:pingidentity/ldapsdk.git).  For any other type of repository,
  it will be a file URL pointing that references the path to the source on the
  build machine filesystem (e.g., ""file:///workspaces/ldap-sdk"").

- A new com.unboundid.ldap.sdk.Version.REVISION_ID constant is available.  Its
  value will be a repository-appropriate identifier for the source repository.
  For a subversion repository, this will be the string representation of the
  revision number.  For a git repository, this will be the SHA-1 digest of the
  most recent commit.  For any other type of repository, the value will be
  ""{unknown}"".

- The com.unboundid.ldap.sdk.Version.REVISION_NUMBER constant is now
  deprecated in favor of the REVSION_ID constant.  It will continue to be
  maintained, but since some types of repositories (like git) do not offer
  numeric revision identifiers, it is not always useful.  If the LDAP SDK was
  checked out from a subversion repository then the value should be accurate,
  but the value will be -1 in all other circumstances.

- All references to the Version.REVISION_NUMBER constant in the LDAP SDK have
  been updated to us Version.REVISION_ID instead.

Note that while this commit includes code that depends on the JGit and slf4j
libraries, those libraries are build-time dependencies only (and they are
checked into the repository, so there is no need to go looking for them).
These libraries are not required in any way when using the LDAP SDK, and the
LDAP SDK's only runtime dependency is Java SE 7 or 8.

The command-line tool API supports an interactive mode that offers a
menu-driven interface that can walk a user through the process of providing
the arguments needed to run the tool.  Tools that support interactive mode
offer an ""--interactive"" argument that can force interactive mode, but they
can also be written so that they default to launching in interactive mode if
no arguments are provided on the command line.

Tools can also support reading the values for one or more arguments from a
properties file.  This can be convenient for cases in which you always run the
tool with a common set of arguments (for example, the arguments used to
connect and authenticate to a directory server).  If the tool supports a
properties file, you can use the ""--propertiesFilePath"" argument to specify
the path to the properties file to use, but it can also determine a default
properties file path from a system property
(com.unboundid.util.args.ArgumentParser.propertiesFilePath) or an environment
variable (UNBOUNDID_TOOL_PROPERTIES_FILE_PATH).

There was a bug that could arise in tools that support both interactive mode
and using a properties file, that default to running in interactive mode when
launched without any arguments, and when a default properties file is set via
system property or environment variable.  In such cases, the tool would
incorrectly start in interactive mode even if one or more argument values
should have been set from the properties file.  This bug has been fixed.

The LDAP distinguished name specification in RFC 4514 allows an attribute
value included in the string representation of a DN or RDN to be provided as
a hex-encoded string, prefixed by the octothorpe character (#), specifying the
raw bytes that comprise that value.  In implementing the LDAP SDK's support
for parsing DNs and RDNs from their string values, this portion of the RFC was
misinterpreted.  The implementation assumed that the hex-encoded string was
comprised entirely of the bytes of the attribute value, but it is actually
supposed to be the complete set of bytes that comprise a BER element (the
type, length, and value), with the RDN attribute value being the value of that
BER element.  As a result, the LDAP SDK was both too lenient with the
hex-encoded values that it would accept (in that it would accept hex-encoded
values that do not represent valid BER elements), and the value that it parsed
incorrectly included the bytes that represented the BER type and length in

Fixed an issue with the LDAP connection pool that could cause the pool to run
out of connections and refuse to create new ones if createIfNecessary is false
and replaceDefunctConnection is unable to create a new connection to replace
a connection that is no longer valid.

The pool did not properly record the failed attempt to create a new
connection, and therefore still assumed that a valid connection was checked
out.  This would cause the pool to operate with a maximum size that is one
less than it should be for each failed replaceDefunctConnection attempt, and
if it happened enough times, the pool would be out of connections and would
refuse to create any new ones.

Previously, the LDAP SDK needed to use reflection for a few reasons that are
no longer applicable.  This falls into a couple of categories:

- Some classees that were part of the Standard Edition needed to use
  reflection to optionally access things in the Commercial Edition if they
  were available, but that is no longer necessary since the LDAP SDK now only
  has a single edition.

- The LDAP SDK needed to support running under Java SE 5, but it used
  reflection to take advantage of additional functionality when running under
  a newer Java version.  Since the LDAP SDK now requires Java SE 7 or later,
  it no longer needs to use reflection for features added in Java SE 6 or 7.

authentication attempt, as well as any current or upcoming issues that might
affect the usability of the authenticated user's account.  The authentication
failure reason has an integer value, a name, and an optional message, and the
LDAP SDK inadvertently duplicated the integer value for two different failure
reasons (one indicating that the account isn't usable, and another indicating
that some unknown problem occurred).  At present, the Directory Server only
uses the ""other"" failure reason in a very specific context that is unlikely to
occur in the vast majority of environments, so I'm changing the integer value
associated with it to avoid this conflict.

The code used to generate the string representation of an RDN from its

2.4, the octothorpe character (#) only needs to be escaped if it appears at
the beginning of an attribute value, and spaces only need to be escaped if
they appear at the beginning or end of a value.  However, the code to generate
the string representation, including the normalized string representation,
would always escape the octothorpe character anywhere in the value, and would
escape all but the last space in a string of consecutive spaces.  This wasn't
technically wrong, since RFC 4514 does allow for more than the minimum amount
of escaping, but it has been observed to cause problems with certain clients,
so we no longer escape the octothorpe or space characters except as required
by the specification.

a DIT below a specified base DN, so that all entries below that base DN will
be exactly one level below that base DN.  This can be used to convert a
highly-branched LDIF to one in which all of the entries are below a common
parent.  Any name-value pairs that are stripped out of the DN during the
flattening process can optionally be added into the entry as attribute values,
and it is also possible to optionally convert the original RDN into a
multivalued RDN that contains all name-value pairs from the original RDN plus
any components that between that RDN and the flatten base DN.

The transformation also provides an option to define an exclude filter, and if
an exclude filter is provided the resulting LDIF will exclude any entry that
resides below the flatten base DN that matches the given filter.  This can be
used to eliminate ""container"" entries whose only purpose in the original LDIF
had been to provide hierarchy that is being eliminated.

Finally, the transform-ldif tool has been updated to provide arguments that
allow it to take advantage of this new flatten subtree transformation.

versions of a property are defined, then the tool-specific version will take
precedence.

check that can warn about certain password-policy-related conditions like an
upcoming password expiration, or can invalidate a connection because of

simplify many kinds of compound filters.  Some of the simplifications it can
make include:

- An AND or OR filter that embeds only a single element will be replaced with
  just that element.  For example, ""(&(attr1=value1))"" will be simplified to
  just ""(attr1=value1)"".

- An AND filter that is embedded inside an AND filter will have its components
  merged into the outer filter.  The same will be done for an OR filter that
  is embedded inside an OR filter.  For example,
  ""(&(attr1=value1)(&(attr2=value2)(attr3=value3)))"" will be simplified to
 ""(&(attr1=value1)(attr2=value2)(attr3=value3))"".

- Any AND filter or OR filter that contains duplicate elements (including
  after simplification using the rules listed above) will have the extra
  copies removed so that there is only a single copy of each element.
  For example, ""(&(attr1=value1)(attr2=value2)(attr1=value1))"" will be
  simplified to ""(&(attr1=value1)(attr2=value2))"".

- You can optionally have the method re-order the elements inside an AND or
  an OR so that they will be in an order that may allow some servers to
  process the filter more efficiently.

The persistence framework has also been updated so that it will take
advantage of this simplification when performing a search that includes a
user-supplied filter along with the filter generated for the object.

search-and-mod-rate, and searchrate tools include support for varying the
target rate over time in accordance with a definition contained in a text file.
The path to this file is specified via the new ""--variableRateData"" argument.

The file must begin with a header in which each line begins with the ""#""
character and has a key-value pair separated by an equal sign.  The supported
header keys include:

- format -- This specifies the format for the variable rate data.  This header
  must be provided.  At present, the only supported format is ""rate-duration"".

- repeat -- This indicates whether the tool should start processing the
  variable rate data from the beginning again once the end of the data has been
  reached (if the value is ""true""), or if the tool should exit (if the value is
  ""false"").  This header is optional, and if it is not provided then the tool
  will exit after the end of the variable rate data has been reached.

- default-duration -- This specifies the default duration that should be used
  for any rate definition line that does not specify a duration.  This header
  is optional, and if it is not provided then all rate definition lines must
  include a duration.

The remainder of the file should include rate definition lines that contain a
target rate followed by a comma and the length of time that rate should be
maintained.  The target rate may be either an integer value to specify the
absolute rate per second, or it may be a floating-point value followed by the
letter ""x"" to indicate that the floating-point value should be used as a
multiplier in conjunction with the value specified by the ""--ratePerSecond""
argument.  The duration should be specified as an integer value followed by a
time unit that may be one of the following:

- nanoseconds, nanosecond, nanos, nano, ns
- microseconds, microsecond, micros, micro, us
- milliseconds, millisecond, millis, milli, ms
- seconds, second, secs, sec, s
- minutes, minute, mins, min, m
- hours, hour, hrs, hr, h
- days, day, d

If a default-duration header is provided, then the duration may be omitted from
one or all of the rate definition lines if the default duration should be used

  is useful for tools that may need to establish LDAP connections (with or
  without SSL or StartTLS) but should not offer authentication capabilities or
  will handle authentication in some other way.

- A new ""--promptForBindPassword"" argument is available that can be used to
  indicate that the tool should interactively prompt the user for the bind
  password rather than requiring it to be provided directly as an argument or
  in a file.  Similarly, new ""--propmtForKeyStorePassword"" and 
  ""--promptForTrustStorePassword"" arguments are available as alternate means 
  of providing key and trust store passwords.

- The tool now does additional argument validation to ensure that the set of
  arguments provided is sensible.  This additional validation includes:
  * If a bind password is provided, then a bind DN or set of SASL options 
    must also be provided.
  * If a key store password is provided, then a key store path must also be
    provided.
  * If a trust store password is provided, then a trust store path must also 
    be provided.
  * If a key store path or trust store path is provided, or if all server
    certificates should be trusted, then the tool must be configured to use

consumption over the useSchema option, since the schema will information will
only be retrieved once per pool rather than once per connection.

Note that it is also possible to associate a timeout with the pooled schema,
and by default that timeout is set to one hour.  If the pooled schema is older
than that timeout, then the next attempt to establish a new connection will
cause the schema to be re-retrieved from the server, and that schema will be
used for new connections until it expires.

multiple threads can use the same socket factory instance to create sockets
concurrently.

A recent change caused all socket factory interaction to be synchronized so
that it was only possible to create a single socket at any one time, since
some IBM VMs were observed to misbehave when trying to create multiple SSL
sockets concurrently from the same socket factory.  However, this introduced
an undesirable side effect that could interfere with the ability to obtain a
connection in a reasonable length of time in the event that one of the target
systems was unavailable in a way that made it completely unresponsible (e.g.,
if the system was powered off or there was a network failure).  The new
default behavior is to allow concurrent socket factory use on Sun/Oracle JVMs,
but require synchronized use on JVMs from all other vendors.  The

- Update the prompt trust manager to provide more useful information about
  certificates listed in the prompts, including MD5 and SHA-1 fingerprints for
  the entire chain and a warning message about self-signed certificates.

- Add a new aggregate trust manager that can be used to combine multiple other
  trust managers in a logical AND or logical OR.  This can be used to create
  a more complex trust manager from a set of simpler trust managers.

- Add a new validity date trust manager that may be used to reject
  certificates for which the current time is outside their validity range.
  This is something that was already available for certain trust managers, but
  this new manager makes it more convenient to get just that functionality,
  and to use it in conjunction with the aggregate trust manager.

- Add a new hostname trust manager that may be used to check a certificate to
  see if it contains a hostname or IP address that matches one of a set of
  expected values.  It looks for certificate hostnames in both the CN
  attribute of the certificate subject and in subjectAltName extensions using
  the dNSName, iPAddress, or uniformResourceIdentifier name types.  Optional
  wildcard support is also available for hostnames used in the CN subject

help avoid the potential for conflicts with messages from other software
packages.

A recent problem reported against the LDAP SDK appears to stem from the fact
that another jar file in the classpath included a ""listener.properties"" file,
and the LDAP SDK was picking up that file instead of the intended version
when trying to find message strings, and when it couldn't find the expected
message key, and exception was being thrown.  To address this problem, two 
changes have been made:

- The names of the message properties files have all been changed so that they
  are prefixed with ""unboundid-ldapsdk-"" (so we're now using
  ""unboundid-ldapsdk-listener.properties"" instead of just
  ""listener.properties""), which means that no other software package should be
  using a properties file name that will conflict with what we're trying to
  use.

- I have updated the code which obtains messages from properties files to more
  gracefully handle the possibility that a properties file exists but does not
  contain an expected message key.

- If LDAPConnectionOptions is configured with a useSchema value of true, then
  connections with equivalent schemas (e.g., because they're established to
  the same servers, or to separate servers with identical schemas) will
  reference the same Schema object rather than multiple equivalent Schema
  objects.  This can save a significant amount of memory when a large number
  of connections should be maintained (e.g., in a connection pool).

- Add a new WeakHashSet utility class, which is basically a HashSet that uses
  weak references to hold its elements.  As soon as an element is no longer
  referenced by reachable code and is eligible for garbage collection, it will
  be automatically removed from the set.  This is currently used to support
  schema caching, but may be used in other ways in the future.

- Fix a potential bug in the way that processing is performed after a bind
  request.  The LDAP SDK caches the last successful bind request processed on
  a connection, and if useSchema is true, will also re-retrieve the schema
  from the server (in case the newly-authenticated user has a different level
  of access to schema information than the user previously authenticated on
  that connection).  This was always done after each successful bind, but
  should not have been done for bind requests that contained the retain
  identity request control.

  of example tools demonstrating the use of the LDAP SDK.

- All of the com.unboundid.ldap.sdk.migrate package and its sub-packages,

  command-line argument parsing.

- Implementations for a number of extended operation types, including LDAP
  transactions, password modify, and Who Am I?.  Support for the cancel and
  StartTLS extended operations is still available.

- Support for SASL authentication.

- A number of other individual classes, primarily from the
  com.unboundid.ldap.sdk and com.unboundid.util packages, which were
  determined to be non-essential in most use cases for space-constrained
  environments.

At present, the Standard Edition jar file is over 1.3MB, while the new Minimal

- It is now possible to start, stop, and restart the server any number of

  had been stopped, so you would have had to create a new server instance.

- It is now possible to have multiple listeners in the same server instance.
  There is no inherent limit on the number of listeners, and you can have
  custom listen address, port, and socket factory configurations for each if
  desired (e.g., to allow a combination of SSL and non-SSL listeners).  You
  can also start, stop, and restart individual listeners without impacting
  other listeners defined in the server.  Each of the listeners will be backed
  by the same data, so a change made over one listener will be immediately
  visible to connections on any of the other listeners for that server
  instance.

It is still possible to have completely independent server instances running
in the same JVM, and in that case, each of those instances will have their own
data that can be maniuplated, and each instance can be stopped or restarted
without impacting the other instances.

The changes made include:

* Add the ability to not automatically generate operational attributes like
  entryDN, entryUUID, creatorsName, createTimestamp, modifiersName,
  modifyTimestamp, and subschemaSubentry in entries added to the server.  This
  may be helpful in simple data processing use cases (e.g., load data from
  LDIF, process some operations against it, and write back to LDIF without all
  these extra attributes).  It is also now possible to explicitly suppress
  these attributes on LDIF export even if they are included in entries.

* Add changelog support, with trimming based on the number of entries.  By
  default, the changelog will be disabled, but you can enable it using
  InMemoryDirectoryServerConfig.setMaxChangelogEntries.  If a changelog is
  enabled, then the changelog, firstChangeNumber, and lastChangeNumber
  attributes will appear in the root DSE.  An option is available to exclude
  changelog attributes for LDIF export.

* Add support for smart referrals.

* Add support for LDAP subentries.

* Add support for a number of controls, including LDAP assertions,
  authorization identity, manage DSA IT, permissive modify, pre-read,
  post-read, proxied authorization v1/v2, LDAP subentries, and subtree delete.
  The root DSE includes a supportedControl attribute with the OIDs of all
  supported request controls.

* Add the ability to process SASL binds.  An API is available to create new
  SASL bind handlers, and the PLAIN mechanism is available by default.
  If any SASL mechanisms are available, then they will be listed in the
  supportedSASLMechanisms attribute of the root DSE.

* Add the ability to process extended operations.  An API is available to
  create new extended operation handlers, and the ""Who Am I?"" and password
  modify operations are available by default.  If any extended operations are
  available, then they will be listed in the supportedExtension attribute of

likely to throw an exception when there is a legitimate failure.  Because
extended operations often return non-success results under normal conditions
(e.g., the cancel extended operation will never return success), the LDAP SDK
will not necessarilly throw an exception simply because it gets a non-success
result.  However, this has caused problems in some cases and it is better to
throw an exception in cases where there is obviously a problem (e.g., the
result indicates the connection is no longer usuable or the server may be in a
weird state).  As a result of this change, the LDAP SDK is now more likely to
throw an exception under conditions where it is confident that some kind of
problem occurred during processing, although simply because it didn't throw an
exception still does not mean that the requested operation was necessarily
processed successfully.

As a side effect, this improves the behavior of the LDAP SDK when attempting
to process extended operations using connections from a connection pool.
Previously, the connection pool did not examine the result from an extended
operation that didn't throw an exception, and under some conditions it could
continue trying to use a connection when it should have been able to determine
that it was no longer valid.

for testing purposes.  It stores all of its data in memory, and provides
utility methods for populating the server and interacting with its contents,
in addition to its support for LDAP clients.  It can automatically select a
free listen port (or use a specifically-configured port if desired), and it
is possible to run multiple instances in the same JVM.

It should cover many common client use cases, but isn't intended to be a
replacement for a full-featured server for clients with more complex
requirements.

It currently provides support for the following features:

- It can optionally be configured with a schema to provide more strict
  compliance and validation.  There is now a new
  Schema.getDefaultStandardSchema() method that will retrieve a schema based
  on definitions in a number of RFCs and Internet drafts.

- Add operations, including adding missing RDN attributes and superior object
  classes.  It will optionally perform schema validation for the entry, and
  will automatically include some operational attributes (e.g., entryDN,
  entryUUID, subschemaSubentry, creatorsName, an createTimestamp) in the entry
  being added.

- Simple bind operations.  SASL authentication is not supported.

- Compare operations are fully supported.

- Delete operations of leaf entries.  It does not currently support subtree
  delete over LDAP, but a method is provided to do that programmatically.

- Modify operations are supported, including schema validation.  The
  modifiersName and modifyTimestamp operational attributes will be udpated.

- Modify DN operations are supported, including the use of newSuperior and
  targeting non-leaf entries.  Schema validation may be performed, and
  modifiersName, modifyTimestamp, and entryDN operational attributes will be
  updated.

- Search operations are supported, including fairly sophisticated support for
  handling requested attribute lists.  Size limits will be enforced but time
  limits will not (since search request size limit granularity can only be
  specified in seconds, and since the data is all in memory it's unlikely
  that any search will take longer than a second).

- Root DSE and schema entries will be generated and may be targeted by search
  and compare operations.  They cannot be altered or removed.

Extended operations are not supported, and therefore all extended requests
will be rejected.  Controls are not supported, and any request containing a
critical control will be rejected (non-critical controls will be ignored).
Abandon requests will be accepted, but will be ignored.  It doesn't currently
support referrals, aliases, LDAP subentries, or schema modifications.

There are methods for easily interacting with the content of the server,
including:

- Counting the number of entries
- Removing all entries
- Adding, removing, and modifying individual entries
- Adding multiple entries (including entries read from LDIF) and removing
  subtrees as atomic operations
- Writing the current content of the server to LDIF
- Gettting individual entries and performing internal searches

The server is primarily meant to be used in an embedded context, and managed
by code.  However, a shell script and batch file are available to run it from
the command line if desired.

for 1 ms, RedHat Linux can sleep for 2 ms, and Solaris can sleep for
10 ms (setting 'hires_tick=1' in /etc/system drops this down to 1ms).

are quoted.  The bulk of this commit introduces a new class,
ExampleCommandLineArgument, that handles the argument quoting.

This class provides access to a form of a command-line argument that is
safe to use in a shell.  It includes both forms for both Unix (bash shell
specifically) and Windows, since there are differences between the two
platforms.  Quoting of arguments is performed with the following goals:

  * The same form should be used for both Unix and Windows whenever
    possible.

  * If the same form cannot be used for both platforms, then make it
    as easy as possible to convert the form to the other platform.

  * If neither platform requires quoting of an argument, then it is not
    quoted.

To that end, here is the approach that we've taken:

  * Characters in the output are never escaped with the \ character
    because Windows does not understand \ used to escape.
  
  * On Unix, double-quotes are used to quote whenever possible since
    Windows does not treat single quotes specially.

  * If a String needs to be quoted on either platform, then it is quoted
    on both.  If it needs to be quoted with single-quotes on Unix, then
    it will be quoted with double quotes on Windows.

  * On Unix, single-quote presents a problem if it's included in a
    string that needs to be singled-quoted, for instance one that includes
    the $ or ! characters.  In this case, we have to wrap it in 
    double-quotes outside of the single-quotes.  For instance, Server's!
    would end up as 'Server'""'""'s!'.

  * On Windows, double-quotes present a problem.  They have to be
    escaped using two double-quotes inside of a double-quoted string.
    For instance ""Quoted"" ends up as """"""Quoted"""""".

All of the forms can be unambiguously parsed using the
parseExampleCommandLine method regardless of the platform.  This
method can be used when needing to parse a command line that was generated
by this class outside of a shell environment, e.g. if the full command line
was read from a file.  Special characters that are escaped include |, &, ;,
(, ), !, "", ', *, ?, $, and `.

The StaticUtils#cleanExampleCommandLineArgument method, which
previously provided this functionality, has been deprecated with
a reference to the new ExampleCommandLineArgument class.

the connection is terminated as a result while trying to read a response from

As an example, this used to be the exception thrown if the server sent a

     An error occurred while processing the search:  The connection to server
     localhost:389 was closed while waiting for a response to search request
     SearchRequest(baseDN='', scope=BASE, deref=NEVER, sizeLimit=0,
     timeLimit=0, filter='(objectClass=*)', attrs={}).

This message doesn't really provide much information about whether the
connection was closed by the client or the server, and what the underlying
reason might have been.  The new message that will be generated in this case
is:

     An error occurred while processing the search:  The connection to server
     localhost:389 was closed while waiting for a response to search request

     the end of this sequence (expected sequence of length 7 to end at 28 bytes
     into the stream, but 33 bytes have already been read from the stream).

At the very least, this message makes it clearer that there was a problem with
what the server sent to the client, and the additional information may help
someone figure out exactly where the problem is (if nothing else, then perhaps
by looking at a network packet capture).

In addition, the result code for the LDAPException may more accurately reflect
the condition that caused this problem.  In the past, it would always be
SERVER_DOWN, but it now may be something more appropriate.  For example, in the
above case it would be DECODING_ERROR.

class, then the generated code will include the following methods for

representations of DNs and RDNs can be constructed:

- When creating a DN from a set of RDNs (or an RDN and a parent DN), it will
  now use the string representations of the provided RDNs (and optional DN)
  rather than reconstructing the entire string representation.  This can help
  preserve a user-supplied string representation if you do something like:
       new DN(existingDN.getRDNs())
  particularly if the existing DN had characters that may be escaped by default
  but don't have to be.

- A new toMinimallyEncodedString method has been added to both the DN and RDN
  classes which may be used to obtain a string representation that performs a
  minimal amount of escaping.  Although it is not technically required by the
  specification, our toString method will escape non-ASCII characters and
  non-printable ASCII characters in order to make the values safer and more
  portable.  Using the toMinimallyEncodedString method will preserve any such
  characters without escaping.

attribute type definitions whose SYNTAX element contains an OID with the
optional minimum upper bound portion present.

Previously, the AttributeTypeDefinition.getSyntaxOID methods always returned
the syntax OID exactly as it was provided in the attribute type definition,
which may or may not have included a minimum upper bound component.  This is
still the case, but I have added some new methods to make it possible to
identify the numeric OID and minimum upper bound portions separately.  In
particular, the getBaseSyntaxOID methods will extract only the numeric OID
portion (and will behave identically to getSyntaxOID if there is no minimum
upper bound portion), and the getSyntaxMinimumUpperBound method will return
the minimum upper bound portion, or -1 if no minimum upper bound is defined.

In addition, the Schema.getAttributeSyntax method has been updated so that it
will ignore any minimum upper bound portion that may be included in the
provided OID.  If the OID provided is only numeric, then it will work as
before without any changes.  If the provided OID also contains a minimum upper
bound in curly braces, then that portion will be ignored and only the numeric
portion of the OID will be used to retrieve the corresponding syntax definition
(whereas before it would have always returned null).

asynchronous mode if the server sends the response to the client in multiple
pieces such that the first piece contains only the BER type or the BER type
but only some of the length for the ASN.1 sequence which is the LDAP message
envelope.  In such cases, the LDAP SDK would properly handle any
SocketTimeoutException exceptions that were encountered before reading the
BER type, but would not properly handle them while trying to read the length
of the sequence.  This could cause the client to encounter an exception and
terminate the connection to the server.

As a result of this change, two methods in the ASN1SequenceReader class have
been marked deprecated.  The methods:

     public boolean ignoreSocketTimeoutException()
     public void setIgnoreSocketTimeout(boolean ignoreSocketTimeout)

have been deprecated and replaced with the following:

     public boolean ignoreInitialSocketTimeoutException()
     public boolean ignoreSubsequentSocketTimeoutException()
     public void setIgnoreSocketTimeout(boolean ignoreInitialSocketTimeout,
                      boolean ignoreSubsequentSocketTimeout)

The ignoreInitialSocketTimeout setting is used to control whether to ignore
a SocketTimeoutException caught while waiting for the first byte (the BER
type), while the ignoreSubsequentSocketTimeout setting is used to control
whether to ignore a SocketTimeoutException caught while reading any byte
after the BER type.

separators for numbers greater than 999 (e.g., so ""12345"" would be formatted as
""12,345""), which is pretty much never what we want to happen.  To ensure that
numbers are presented without the grouping separators, we now use placeholders
like ""{0,number,0}"" for numbers.

it exhibits when interacting with a directory server that is completely
unresponsive (e.g., as in the case where the network cable has been
disconnected from the server system, or the server process has been halted with
the pstop command).  These changes include:

- Make a change to the way that the socket used for a connection is
  established.  We previously relied upon the ability to create a disconnected
  socket and then call the Socket.connect method which included a timeout.
  However, this did not always work as intended because some socket factories
  (e.g., javax.net.ssl.SSLSocketFactory) did not support the ability to create
  disconnected sockets, and even for those that did the timeout wasn't always
  reliable, especially in the case of a completely unresponsive server.  We now
  use a separate thread to establish the socket in a manner that is much more
  reliable and will work for any type of socket factory.

- Update the set of result codes that may indicate a connection is no longer
  useable to include the TIMEOUT result code.  This is a conservative list that
  tries to generate more false positives than false negatives, so even if the
  connection really may still be usable, it's safer to suggest that it may not
  be.

- Make it possible to set explicit response timeouts for bind and extended
  requests, since that was already the case for all other types of requests.
  For bind and extended requests, it was previously only possible to use the
  timeouts assigned to the underlying connection through the connection
  options.

- Update all types of requests so that duplicating the request will ensure that
  the request-specific timeout is also set on the duplicate.  Previously, when
  duplicating a request, any per-request timeout would have been lost.

functionality like automatically including timestamps, adding support for
other output formats (like tab-delimited text), and placing other content in a
field normally intended for numeric output.

new approach.  They also now provide support for two additional command-line
arguments:

* --timestampFormat {none|with-date|without-date} -- This can be used to
  indicate that timestamps should be included in the generated output, and
  the format that should be used for representing them.  This is useful for
  cases in which the tool is used for a long-running test so that if something
  interesting happens during the test you can easily tell when it occurred.

* --warmUpIntervals {num} -- This can be used to indicate that the tool should
  be allowed to run for the specified number of intervals before beginning
  overall statistics collection, to allow both the client and the server to
  warm up.  If warm up intervals are to be used, then recent statistics will
  be displayed for each of them, but the overall statistics will not (and the
  value of those columns will be ""warming up"").
