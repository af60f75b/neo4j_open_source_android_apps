It would be better to exclude it via query flags, but I haven't found a flag
that works to this end.

This resolves the issue where the chooser always displays on newer versions of

In short, we can't edit the intent we received, because it will be used to
re-launch on rotate.  If we edit it, the wrong app is launched (and fails).

Also adds a ScrollView around the upper portion so the copy button can be used
while in landscape mode.
