Potential fix for the libpng security vulnerability: switch to new AAPT binaries. I won't know if this fix worked until I try uploading the APK to Google Play.

Fix two build issues affecting all Android 7.0 Nougat devices - DX Merger NoSuchMethodError and a package installer permissions problem (the latter was not discovered until after fixing the former).

The NoSuchMethodError proved a tough nut to crack. The problem was that core-libart (the core Android library) contains the Dex library but not DX Merger. The dx.jar library included in the libs folder contains both Dex and DX Merger as is necessary, but both libraries (in the project and in core-libart) used the same package name. This caused the ClassLoader to always load the core-libart version of Dex and the dx.jar version of DX Merger - two different versions of the same library trying to work together. With API 24, the method signature for com.android.dex.TableOfContents.writeHeader() changed, leading to a NoSuchMethodError when the older dx.jar DX Merger tried to access the newer core-libart method. This problem was solved by changing the package name of the included dx.jar library with the Jar Jar Links JAR re-packager tool so that the ClassLoader always loads the dx.jar version of both Dex and DX Merger. In accordance with the tool's name, the new package name starts with ""com.androidjarjar"".

The package manager permissions problem was due to the removal of MODE_WORLD_READABLE by way of causing a SecurityException on Nougat. In its place I have implemented a FileProvider to do things the ""right way"", but this seems to cause problems below API level 24 so the old method is left in place for pre-Nougat devices. The ""right way"" also requires the REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES permission on API 23+. This permission is therefore only requested on API 23+.

Also target API 25, upgrade to the latest support library, and remove the MIPS AAPT binary.

The old examples repo wasn't as forward-thinking as I thought it was. The problem was that when we updated the examples in such a way that they were no longer backwards-compatible (like upgrading to the Android Mode 3.0.1 examples), it wasn't possible to prevent the older versions of the app from also getting the newer examples that wouldn't work for those versions.

Therefore, I have created a new examples repository for v0.4.0+, which will have a separate branch each time that the examples are updated in a non-backwards-compatible way. The code that checks for examples updates has been changed accordingly.

The entire app is now fully Material Design-ified and functional, with the notable exception of saving temporary sketches. A new temporary sketch system will be implemented shortly.

In the future, the minSdk will have to be changed to API level 15 (Android 4.0.3), which is what the newer versions of the desktop Android Mode currently support. I haven't actually made this change yet, but I have started dropping support for 2.3.3, for example in the Settings screen.

The changes included in this commit are numerous and I have lost track of many of them. They include using all of Google's support libraries, including the very buggy preference library (for which I am using a third party fix) for the new-and-improved Settings screen. I have changed to using the support library's TabLayout for the tab bar, which is much cleaner than what I had before. I have re-done a lot of the layouts so that they look correct with the new Material widgets and icons. There are many other changes and bugfixes that I can't think of right now.

Now using ViewPager to switch between tabs, which is a huge change from the hacky, unsupported, and now-impossible method from before. Various work in all parts of the application, currently not fully functioning, but has to be committed. Also, switch to using some of Google's Material icons.

FileMeta is now SketchFile, to better represent what it actually is. There are now fragments associated withe every SketchFile for the ViewPager, just to make things more confusing.

The examples repository is cloned in the app from Calsign/APDE-examples,
which is a modified version of the Android mode examples. The examples
are stored in a separate repository to enable asynchronous updates and
to decrease the size of the APK file. The INTERNET and
ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE permissions were added to enable downloading of the
repository. Next up is full-blown git support.
Adding the git libraries pushed the size of the DEX file over the method
limit. The bulk of the methods came from third party libraries, not APDE
source code. To remedy this problem, we had to enable ProGuard shrinking
(not optimization or obfuscation) for debug builds. However, Eclipse
ADT's build system doesn't support ProGuard except for release builds,
so we have switched to Ant. The necessary build files and ProGuard files
are included in this commit.
An assortment of minor bug fixes and improvements are also included in
this commit.",,,,William Smith,calsignlabs@gmail.com,William Smith,calsignlabs@gmail.com,1417657414,1417657414,1aebefe6155cf88ff8b739dcb42abd4f7a3a2d2f
