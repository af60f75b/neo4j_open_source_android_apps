* Some transition work for opening the item activity

* Revamp all the things

- Created Crest Models for networking use only
- Moving to AP ORM for speed and readability
- Moved around some stuff
- Moving to RXJava responses on Retrofit
- Split out loaders based on their uses
- So much more...

* Started ORM Stuffs.

* Rewrite Continued.

- Updated all Database calls
- Updated Loaders
- Updated Adapters and Activities
- Rewrote Margin code to be way more efficient
- Updated Crest Models
- etc.

* Continued Work. Citadel Endpoints update.

* Application is buildable

So far the caching works, just need to figure out how to do the paging.
Once done I need to test the subjects I have setup for the tab loading.

* Make Market Type Caching More efficient.

* Caching Kinda works again, Orders load, and navigation is all fixed

- Caching seems to work, but some Database Transaction work needs to be
done
- Navigation of the groups all works
- Opening items works again
- Orders are now pulled with one network request and pushed to each tab
(sell, buy, margins)
- Regions is now cached so you don't have to continuously change it
every time you open an item. Unless otherwise passed in (by another
application) your region will be the same as it was before
- Caching of regions works (still needs wormhole filter)
- Station Margin Building works (just needs a view)
- Moved region on change event so it shouldn't trigger multiple requests
for orders.
- Tons more I'm missing.

* Fixed Caching

- Database transaction should be broken up instead of all 13030 items at
once
- Added Travis CI build info

* Market Margins now work

- Market History is all set up with grid, it just crashes due to labels
- Tons more done and cleaned up

* Market History is working

* Bug fixes, getting ready for next release

- Fixed orientation bug on item screen where orders and history didn't
repopulate after switching orientation
- Fixed issue with timeout and navigating away from item before all the
network calls are done
- Partially fixed issue where it looks like the app hangs when it is
waiting for the database queue to finish.
- Fixed issue with mass and volume being ginormous throwing off the
entire view
- Removed SwipeRefreshLayouts from tabs since they will no longer be
used
- Cleaned up history graph (if the graph isn't crazy in the first place)
it is much easier to read

* v2.0

* Fixed timeouts and x-axis label render errors

* Bug Fixes

- Fixed crash that happens when an item's mass is > 1 quadrillion kg

* Added market order back in

- Started working on creating bots

* Deploy v2.0.3

- Fixed CCP endpoint changes from June 14th deploy

* Fix Merge Error

* Fixes for loading and graph

- If there is no market history the app will no longer crash
- If getting the item info times out (which seems to happen a lot on the
new deploy) it no longer crashes
