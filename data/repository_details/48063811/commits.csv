Most of the debug has been left in.

There appears to be an error in the Quora site. What is required is:
    Calculate the virtual hour hand (based on the moon phase)
    Point the virtual hour at the moon
    Halfway between the ""actual"" hour hand and the reference hour is South

Tidied up some comments
Quite a bit of debug still present (and toast messages), but need to keep checking, especially when the moon is waxing
When waning, it appeared to work in the morning.
