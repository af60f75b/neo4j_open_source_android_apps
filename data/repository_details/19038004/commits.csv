    Fix cached zip search for events so that subsequent searches return results

    Latitude and longitude are cached for a particular zip code. They are stored
    as strings with a ""|"" delimiter. Splitting on that delimiter was not
    correct, and would result in splitting on the empty string. Escaping the
    pipe like so: ""\\|"" resolves the issue, so the second through Nth search
    for the same zip will now return event results.

    Handle venue search that only returns one venue.

    There was a JSONException being thrown for trying to cast a JSONObject to
    a JSONArray. This happens when there's only one venue result returned from
    last.fm. So wrap that one result in a JSONArray and continue on as normal.

    Also render the venue list better for rows that have no street address.

 - Modify ID select query to remove erroneous single quotes

In addition to these changes, also remove old build framework artifacts

The need for dependency resolution in the web services pushed the module
to use maven instead of ant. But instead of using maven to build the whole

plugins nor the ant maven interactivity plugins.

SearchIntermediate is the new activity that allows a user to decide whether

then actually search by whichever category they chose.

SearchVenue still has problems and I'm not sure why. More investigation will
need to be done in this area.
