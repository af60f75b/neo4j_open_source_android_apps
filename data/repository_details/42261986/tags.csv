bf8a457f8cea157aaf283ce44c6a299d4ac40e16,version-0.0.9,"Fixed a crash

Also increase the long long press timeout; long pressing ""e"" to get ""Ã©"" should
now be more usable."
5bf8db8df3e3286948a67fc2c621470ff7dbe70e,version-0.0.8,"Multitouch, buffering and improved cleanup

Hitting two keys at the same time will now enter both chars. Good for quick
typists.

If the app that the keyboard is talking to is slow, the keyboard will now do its
own buffering to remain responsive.

I've once seen the hint window still lingering after the keyboard is gone. This
release contains an attempted fix for that. Whether or not it works is hard to
say since I haven't been able to reproduce the problem though."
91e6354c93da686d8200b041bcab02169205a46c,version-0.0.7,"Fix repeating backspace removing one char too many

Also add another vibration when pressing OK in the vibration duration selection
preferences."
a8326b7365ebcd49e94d4bf9239b0a99ff2c2851,version-0.0.6,"Add vibration duration preference

All device vibration units are not made equal, so the vibration duration needs
to be tunable for the duration to make sense on all devices.

Yay for beta testing!"

Fix hold-delete behavior (it was too quick before this release)

Attempt to make vibrations more robust. It didn't work on all phones, this
change may or may not fix that."

a4a72b03bc5bc7d91045160af429adc84df9e183,version-0.0.2,"Fix keyboard mode issues

ade4b1cb18d0318a614a3879af21553b2abb1276,version-0.0.11,"Fix bogus detection of spaces and newlines

This release changes the allowed marigin of error for detecting touches as
keypresses rather than swipes. The effect is that all the misdetections of
keypresses as swipes that I've had have gone away."
