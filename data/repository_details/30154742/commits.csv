The method `LogItem.getDate()` was returning a date
with the user's TimeZone, so the query to them didn't
work.

Some other minor changes and version upgrades.

Fixed a problem where you could fill entries in the future and that was
breaking the history view. In order to fix it three actions have been taken:
- The select date dialog has a max date
- Pressing the + date button to get a future date shows an alert (toast)
- The history dialog selects the dates to show setting max date today

Added the possibility to define how the urticaria has limited you (work, socialize...) in a similar way as angioedema  was defined.
The db has been updated to have this field and also to support pictures as well (although it's still not implemented).
Fixed a small bug with export, now it should work now in older versions as we are not using Environment.DIRECTORY_DOCUMENTS.

That's my first android app and I hacked it in a weekend so still lots of improvements.
I've tried to have as less dependencies as possible, that's whey some pieces of the code would be better done with guava or a DI framework.
Need to add tests as I didn't have enough time to play with them and, ideally, do some refactor with that.
