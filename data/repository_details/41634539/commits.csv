The reason is that the drawer is handled fine, and before, the assumption
was that the drawer would govern everything, so it was handled. However
now there's non-drawer screens which handle their own transaction state and
backstack. In this case this is a bit of a hack. Hopefully if it continues
there migth be a need to refactor this all so theres only 1 root to the app.
Instead of using the drawer as the root

The idea is you can subscribe to the observable that tells you
what state the refresh is in at any time. If you leave the screen
and come back, it doesn't matter, you're completely stateless.

The other part is if you want to refresh, you just push the PublishSubject
and you never have to worry about it again, the observable mentioned above
gets updated correctly

Also, tests works. Only caveat is the tests have a `wait` style problem
because Rx takes time. TestObserver helps but its not meant for infinite streams
which is what we're using

Started with requiring 1.8 to compile against SDK 24.
Then Jack toolchain is required for 1.8
Jack doesn't support annotations, so dagger blows up.
Fix is to update to 2.2.0-alpha5 of gradle tools that supports
annotation processing
Then dagger and dagger-compiler had to be updated to version 2.5

But, now android-apt is useless, so 1 less dependancy
