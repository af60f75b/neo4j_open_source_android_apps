It appears we can no longer use the ""sortBy"" param to order results
coming back from the server. Luckily we sort client-side at query time,
so that wasn't crucial. Unfortunately that also means we can no longer
retrieve paged results - chunks of 50 at a time, from
least-recently-updated to most-recently-updated. So instead I've decided
to go with an arbitrary ""up to 1000 most recent events"". This will have
no discernible effect for most users of the app.
This changes the timestamp format to also remove any timezone or
milliseconds information, as the server no longer accept timestamps in
that format.

important, as I've been getting a few unexpected parse failures - the

URL it works. So I need to log the body to figure out what's going on,
but I can't do that since the body is a 1-shot stream. So here we read
the body to a string and only then do we try to parse it.

We now inject the RealmConfiguration into the Application at startup
and then set that as default. The idea of injecting a Realm doesn't
work because of it's threading restrictions. Take the
NetworkRunnerService for example; if it injects in its constructor, the
Realm is created on the wrong thread. If it injects in its handleIntent
method, then it can't use any other injected objects until then. If we
use a Lazy injection, then every time we query for it we get the same
Realm - even after closing it!
The benefit of retrieving your own Realm when you need (apart from it
being easier to figure out what thread it should be accessed from) is
it also makes it more obvious when it should be closed.

I was originally planning on combining origintime + modification time
to be smart about retrieving only recent issues that have been updated,
but that creates a complex mess of scenarios. It's much simpler to just
get ""everything that's been updated since our last update"" and not
worry too much about outliers.

Note this breaks the tests.

nonetheless. Also, this method is faster.
