Also increase the long long press timeout; long pressing ""e"" to get ""é"" should
now be more usable."
"Tag","tag:22002","version-0.0.8","Multitouch, buffering and improved cleanup

Hitting two keys at the same time will now enter both chars. Good for quick
typists.

If the app that the keyboard is talking to is slow, the keyboard will now do its
own buffering to remain responsive.

I've once seen the hint window still lingering after the keyboard is gone. This
release contains an attempted fix for that. Whether or not it works is hard to
say since I haven't been able to reproduce the problem though."
"Tag","tag:22003","version-0.0.7","Fix repeating backspace removing one char too many

Also add another vibration when pressing OK in the vibration duration selection
preferences."
"Tag","tag:22004","version-0.0.6","Add vibration duration preference

All device vibration units are not made equal, so the vibration duration needs
to be tunable for the duration to make sense on all devices.

Yay for beta testing!"
"Tag","tag:22005","version-0.0.5","Remove popup when tapping keys

Fix hold-delete behavior (it was too quick before this release)

Attempt to make vibrations more robust. It didn't work on all phones, this
change may or may not fix that."

"Tag","tag:22009","version-0.0.11","Fix bogus detection of spaces and newlines

This release changes the allowed marigin of error for detecting touches as
keypresses rather than swipes. The effect is that all the misdetections of
keypresses as swipes that I've had have gone away."

This is a hotfix release designed to fix regressions found in v0.4.9.

Settings were not being properly saved, so any change to the settings
would result in not being actually remembered the next time the game
loads.

This hotfix release also fixes a bug where the statistics would not be
properly saved, although this has been found to be introduced in 0.4.8.

This release focuses on adding a few long-time requested features to the
game. Also, I have updated a lot of library versions in order to make
future changes easier. Future versions will continue adding
long-requested features and making small changes to the codebase to make
it easier to maintain. No expected dates.

* Combinations are now unselected as soon as a ball with the wrong color
  is selected (fixes #56).

* Less score will be given for combinations made using a hint (#61).

* Statistics will now display how many hints have you used (#70).

* More time is now rewarded for better combinations (#72).

* A share button has been added to the Statistics screen (#50).

Also I have made a few changes to the development process in order to
make release and deployment easier in the future.

* Dropped support for desktop. Rectball is now mobile first game. I'm
  doing this because keeping the Java Desktop version in pace with the
  changes I'm doing in the Android project is hard.

* Google Play Edition is now open source. This means that it is possible
  to build a version linked against Google SDK. No API keys have been
  uploaded so the project will fail to build.

* Both Google Play Edition and Open Source Edition will coexist as
  flavors. Just use releaseGpe or releaseOsp as Gradle tasks when
  building the project.

  beginning of the game.
* It's not required to restart the game to switch fullscreen mode.

Internal changes:

* More code is ported to Kotlin.
* Replaced libGDX's I18NBundle with Android strings.

* Fixed a regression introduced in Rectball 0.4.9 that made it
  impossible to activate fullscreen mode in Android 4.3 and older.

    - (Damien Stuart) Added support for libnetfilter_queue so that fwknopd can
      acquire SPA packets via the NFQ target. This feature is enabled with a
      new command line switch '--enable-nfq-capture' for the configure script,
      and libpcap is not required in this mode. In support of capturing SPA
      packets via the NFQ target, new configuration variables have been added
      to the fwknopd.conf file: ENABLE_NFQ_CAPTURE, NFQ_INTERFACE, NFQ_PORT,
      NFQ_TABLE, NFQ_CHAIN, NFQ_QUEUE_NUMBER, and NFQ_LOOP_SLEEP.

"Tag","tag:46303","2.6.8","fwknop-2.6.8 (12/23/2015):
    - [server] Added a major new feature that allows fwknopd to easily
      integrate with third-party devices and software. This done through the
      addition of a generic ""command open"" and ""command close"" capability, and
      a set of variable substitutions are supported such as '$SRC', '$PORT',
      and '$PROTO'. This feature is designed to allow the user to switch out
      the default firewall - iptables, firewalld, ipfw, or PF - for something
      complete different. For example, here is a write-up on using this feature
      to integrate SPA operations with ipset:

        https://cipherdyne.org/blog/2015/12/single-packet-authorization-and-third-party-devices.html

    - [server] (Jonathan Bennett) Added new access.conf directives
      '%include <file>' and '%include_folder <directory>'. This allows more
      access stanzas to be defined in other locations in the filesystem, and
      this can be adventageous in some scenarios by letting non-privledged
      users define their own encryption and authentication keys for SPA
      operations. This way, users do not need write access to the main
      /etc/fwknop/access.conf file to change keys around or define new ones.
    - [server] Bug fix to not send the TCP server a TERM signal even when it is
      not running when fwknopd receives a HUP signal.
    - [libfko] Bug fix for a crash that could be triggered in
      fko_set_username() when a username that is 64 chars or longer is
      specified. This crash cannot be triggered in fwknopd even if an SPA
      packet contains such a username however due to additional protections in
      the SPA decoding routines. Further, this bug does not apply to the main
      fwknop client either because the maximal username size is truncated down
      below 64 bytes. Hence, this bug only applies to client-side software that
      is directly using libfko calling the fko_set_username() function.
    - [test suite] Code coverage is now at 90.7% counted by lines. The complete
      coverage report for the 2.6.8 release is available here:

This version fixes several bugs with the v2.0 build which interfered with the correct function of the application.

There is, at the moment, only one remaining issue left. That issue is the ongoing issue with calculations seeming to propagate results despite being clear.

It is possible that it does not occur with the changes made or that it only occurs on unclean builds (which I never release), so if it doesn't show up soon the build will be declared a beta.

This version includes complex mathematics as a backing for all operations, including the custom java class which can be used for general complex math operations.

THIS VERSION WILL HAVE PROBLEMS. It will have numerous bugs, which might interfere with correct results, and it might even have crashes. It has been tested so that common operations on real numbers have correct results, at least when such results are obvious. Use it at your own risk: For real usage, any non-alpha version will be more suitable.

"Tag","tag:98624","v2.0","Version 2.0: Complex numbers release

After a long development process, it is finally here. Version 2.0, the much awaited release whose pre-release builds are more numerous than all releases in the 1.x series, has arrived.

Version 2.0 expands the set of numbers the calculator can work with from the set of real numbers (representable by a double) to the set of complex numbers (whose real and imaginary parts are representable by a double apiece). All operations support both complex inputs and outputs (therefore, for example sqrt(-1) no longer generates ""Error: Complex result""), with the exception of Prime?, which only functions with real numbers. A new operation, ""Is a Gaussian Prime?"" checks for gaussian primality, which is the equivalent for complex numbers - however, not all prime numbers are Gaussian primes.

Smaller improvements over v1.2.1 include better support for Android TV and certain tablets, with better use of the dual-pane layout, an optimizing build process which significantly shrinks the APK size, and default values for operations where the default value of 0 generated a divide-by-zero error (divide, divide from, and remainder).

This is a momentous step in the development of this application, and the fruit of many hours of work, so with this release I will be taking a short break from adding new features. Github does list several issues which shall be fixed to make the v2.1 release, which I will start working on after said break.

That said, I will continue fixing bugs if any are found and reported to me. Bugfix releases, released as v2.0.1, will be released whenever available.
