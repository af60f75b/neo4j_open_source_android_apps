En este proyecto en particular nos hemos centrado en la administración del congreso SEIO (Congreso Nacional de Estadística e Investigación del año 2012), aunque la idea principal es que sea relativamente fácilmente portable a otros congresos. La aplicación se ha diseñado para que pueda permitir al usuario, gestionar su programa durante los días del congreso. Una agenda integrada que permite ver de manera cronológica, las sesiones que éste haya seleccionado como favoritas (así como ordenarlas según diferentes criterios para una mejor usabilidad). También se le ofrece la posibilidad de añadir eventos y alertas en el calendario de su dispositivo para recibir notificaciones y saber con antelación a que sesión debe acudir y donde.  Otro de los problemas que Congress Droid pretende resolver es el tema de la localización de las sedes. La aplicación pone a disposición de los usuarios un servicio de mapas (Google maps) con indicadores sobre cada una de las sedes del congreso. El usuario también será capaz de interactuar desde la propia aplicación con el resto de personas que estén siguiendo el congreso.","1449006730","0","0","1","0","0","User","-1","-1"

It figures a tip based on the actual cost of a meal.  The actual cost is the amount paid on the bill, excluding sales tax, but including any discounts that were applied.  This insures your server gets tipped fairly.  TOD will split a bill between multiple parties and let you round each share to, say, the nearest dollar.  It will show you the actual tip percentage after rounding.  TOD also supports bumping the tip up or down to the next rounded amount.  There is no ""calculate"" button in TOD.  All calculations are performed on the fly as you type.  The code makes full use of JUnit test cases and Android JUnit test cases.  Since it is a relatively small application, it should be useful to those who want to learn Android development and automated unit testing. ","1335039807","0","1","2","1","0","User","-1","-1"

"GitHubRepository","22467863","donaldmunro","AARemu","http://localhost/gitlab/donaldmunro_aaremu","1512237067","AARemu is a software tool enabling simulation of Augmented Reality  by allowing an AR developer to record either an interactive 360 degree or a non-interactive free-form view of a location using the devices camera and orientation sensors (this functionality is provided by the ARemRecorder app). The ARCamera/ARCameraDevice  classes which provides a mock implementation of the Android Camera API classes can then be used to preview the recorded scene instead of the live camera preview provided by the Android Camera class. The preview callback is analogous to the standard Camera preview  callback except that the preview bytes provided in the callback  are extracted from a file created by the recorder application. These preview bytes are passed to the development code  via the same preview callback as provided by the standard Camera   classes and can thus be processed by Computer Vision algorithms  before being displayed by the client application. The frames are  stored as individual video frames in RGBA format  and not as video so the preview can be accessed in any direction. The tool is aimed at developers of mobile AR applications as it allows the developer to record view(s) of a given location and then debug and test the AR application in the comfort of a office or home without having to  make extensive changes to the programming  code.","1406808376","8","24","7","24","8","User","-1","-1"

The android app communicates with the arduino wirelessly and turns on and off Light, Fan and Sound devices connected to the arduino. The Light,Fan and Sound devices are connected to the arduino via breadboard and wires respectively. The arduino receives power from the USB cable. PHP language is used to pass messages to the arduino using the serial com port of the PC via the USB cable.  The goal of this experiment is to demonstrate the flexibility and power of the android operating system when used together with the arduino UNO board. This experiment proves that anyone with basic programming skills can create something very useful.","1460459983","0","1","1","1","0","User","-1","-1"
