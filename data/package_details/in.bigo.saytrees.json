  "descriptionHtml": "We planted saplings in the memory of our friend, as planting sapling which will later grow into vibrant, beautiful tree benefits everyone in this and future generations and thereby makes it the most fitting memorial, which can live for years to come.<br><br>We have been planting trees in Bangalore since 2007. This is just a small step to save the oxygen factories around us. These tree plantation drives in Bangalore spreads awareness among citizens and makes them understand the importance of trees around us. We try to make sure we involve as many people as possible in our plantations. We have had tree plantation drive in Bangalore where more than 300 people have participated. We expect kids to come and plant saplings along with their parents. We expect school students to come and plant saplings with their friends and understand the need of trees around us.<br><br>We are trying to cover many Govt. Schools and lakes in bangalore and making sure many trees are planted in these places. We are reaching out to many individuals and asking them to help us in doing plantation in lakes which are far from the city. We wish to save far off lakes as well. Trees serve as natural boundary for lakes and give shelter to many birds.<br><br>We are trying to engage with schools and wish to have small sessions with students and educate them regarding the need of trees around us and tell them the importance of trees. These are the individuals who will face worse conditions if we don&#39;t act now. We wish to start tree plantation in other cities across India.<br><br>Approximately 300 trees can counter balance the amount of pollution 1 person produces in life time.<br> A single 30-meter-tall mature tree can absorb as much as 22.7 kilograms (50 pounds) of carbon dioxide in a year, which is approximately the same amount as would be produced by an average car being driven 41,500 kilometers (25,787 miles). The same tree could also produce 2,721 kilograms (5,998.78 pounds) of oxygen in a year, which is enough to support at least two people. One tree supports hundreds species of insects.<br><br>What tree lovers say about us:<br><br>We planted saplings in the memory of our friend, as planting sapling which will later grow into vibrant, beautiful tree benefits everyone in this and future generations and thereby makes it the most fitting memorial, which can live for years to come. It can carry forward the name of our friend in the most vital way that grows grander with the years. With the help of a very humble coordinator , who was easily reachable to answer all our queries,We had a wonderful experience working with SayTrees. Unlike, planting trees at corporate event, which is a mere formality, SayTrees gave us an opportunity to do the hard work right from plowing to planting and thereby we felt satisfied at the end of our endeavor . The event was well coordinated , with no lack of equipment of raw material, thus making it memorable for all of us. Thank you. -- Ankita, Amanpreet kaur seva trust. [Plantation Date : 13 Sept 2014]<br><br>Tree planting event was an extraordinary experience for me. Initially I was in it as a part of corporate initiative. It was so exiting that I followed it up by participating in few more events with my family and friends. In every event we could see so many volunteer participating with great enthusiasm and enjoying the planting. It was fun and exiting experience to be part of these events, while doing something good for the planet. The events were coordinated very well by Saytrees. Their planning, timely communication and direction was excellent. The way they actively participation with us in each and every event shows their commitment and genuine passion for the cause. I liked the activity so much that I have decided to be part of these events next year and years following. The overall experience was of most gratifying, purposeful and memorable. -- Kishore Govinde, SAN Locomotive [Plantation Date:5 Jun, 13 Sept, 2 Nov 2014]",
